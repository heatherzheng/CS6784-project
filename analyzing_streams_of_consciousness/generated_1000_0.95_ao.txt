The gravitational-wave burst (GW) and merger remnant (GWR) inspiral waveforms are essential parameters for calculating the cosmological GW background. The most accessible class of theories predicts the standard time series of observable GW properties, but theoretical work presents no strong evidence that such a value is consistently defined. In this paper, we investigate the inspiral waveform prediction in the adiabatic limit. We show that adiabatic parameter constraints can be evaluated in the case that we define $H_{\rm B}\equiv\gamma \gamma^\alpha$. We present a simple calculation of the impact of the assumed mass ratio $\mathcal{O}(10)$, $M_{\mathrm{b}\sin i}$, on the model fitting $\gamma$ profile, $A(1)$, and the merger rate $B(1)$, with both parameters being assumed to represent neutralino masses $\mathcal{O}(10)^{1}$ in the plane of the sky. In addition, we provide an analytical expression for the time-dependent mass ratio and merger rate $B(1)$, with a temporal dependence at high density with respect to $A(1). We find that the velocity dispersions of relativistic particles that propagate into the background are affected by the preheating horizon at the center of the active nucleus ($T_{\rm Pb} \leq 13\times 10^{52}$ s$^{-1}$), and this effect depends on the physical conditions in the massive binary merger (more massive ones get closer to the merger and hence enter the BBN). Finally, we show that, unlike standard models, the coupling constant $v \simeq \mathcal{O}(10)^{-3}$ is determined by a Bayesian dynamical model that predicts the high mass ratio, $A(1)$, and the merger rate, $B(1)$, for large initial masses $M_\mathrm{b}\sim 4 \times 10^{42}$ g, respectively. 
We first present a new derivation for the Hamiltonian equations of motion in the harmonic gauge. In the harmonic gauge, Newtonian actions and the non-minimal derivative of the Hamiltonian momentum in the Hamiltonian metric, respectively, are obtained analytically in order to show that the minimal derivative of the Hamiltonian energy conserves itself over time as a function of the mass, so that the method we have studied can in principle be extended to different classes of models. The derivation is presented in the form of a program and applications to Einstein-Maxwell equations of motion in the harmonic gauge, with special attention to the coordinate system of the hydrodynamic equations. The diagram of numerical solutions and physical quantities, together with numerical examples, shows that the Hamiltonian equations can be written in a complete and homogeneous form, with the definition of the non-linear $L_\Lambda$ scalar invariant. The integral equations, while showing very accurate solutions, are degenerate into a prescribed new scalar and a free (even non-zero) value of the Hamiltonian momentum. We also study the relation between the effective Newtonian action and the vector (or the effective gravitational force) in the Hamiltonian metric. The full expression can be extended to any scalar, provided that the effective Newtonian action is always at the moment when the vector becomes positive. We illustrate the observability of this new Hamiltonian action for realistic linear gravity problems in the absence of general relativity. 
Baryons moving in a merging dense cloud should be replaced by deuterium (i.e., heavier nuclei) at the site of the merger, which could be associated with the early epoch of black hole formation in most central stars. In this work, we investigate the probability for this problem to be of general relativity, and compare it with an extrapolation of the stellar evolution in a massive black hole via Jeans mass. We consider all numerical simulations available for Einstein gravity to demonstrate that this scenario does not require a suitable version of the general relativity theory, but instead requires models in which deuterium is depleted in dense cloud cores in the collapse phase and it forms stars in hot phase of star formation. We find that the required deuterium distribution in the Milky Way is as strong as that in the Universe, with a 99.7% confidence level upper limit on the distribution of masses. For mass values > 20 eV, the observed baryon distribution agrees well with the expectation for generic theories of gravity. The need for improved initial conditions leads to a robust prediction that the mass of a B-collapse supermassive black hole is not variable within the simulation, though with a 95% confidence level upper limit. 
For a scalar field with small amplitude inflation, perturbations in inflationary dynamics may exist on the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background. The curvature perturbations can be quantified by the Ricci scalar field. The contribution of the Ricci scalar field to the inflaton mass $M_{\rm infl}$ is explicitly described using generalized version of the "Lineshift" (Glammerberg-Eddington) instability which is valid only at small scalar inflaton masses. The Glammerberg-Eddington instability can be obtained also in the presence of scalar and tensor perturbations on a single inflaton. The power of this instability is calculated to be around 10^{-20}$ for the most-squares-of-thrones approximation. We also discuss the possibility of non-gaussianity with very small $M_{\rm infl}$. 
While there is debate on the height of the "parity of p" in space-time, it appears that it is bounded by a phi-phantom term with an appropriate covariance matrix. The discussion is based on the solution of a perturbative gravitational field theory in space-time to the Einstein-Hilbert-Vlasov problem, in which the theory is unified with a 4D idealized kinetic theory, in the form of a quartic volume and an exotic energy scale, and in an exact set of bound space-time density measures. The results of this work show that the inflaton potential is effectively indistinguishable from a phantom scalar, and show that it might be measurable at late times, though a very short duration, using the phantom potential itself. 
The derivation of gravitational waves by the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and its application to braneworld are presented in the context of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) model. This physical model predicts a distinctive behavior for the Born equations, its origin and evolution, the Planck temperature and mass density, and the Lagrangian term, tau(z), of the perturbations, which holds regardless of the cosmological background at the origin. We study these well-motivated models by construction and discuss how they differ from Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet. As an example of the evolution of tau(z), we consider relativistic perturbations of spherically symmetric fluctuations in such an EGB model. We propose a novel type of relativistic linear perturbation for this geometry, which is one of the most natural solutions available to date. The geometrical description of the model, suitable for the modeling of neutron stars, is extended to include future gravitational waves and the very complicated equations related to Kerr black holes in the EGB model. 
Based on the position and gravity of two branes of a gauge background, we investigate the compactness of the system of Kerr-de Sitter particle "virtual black holes" inside of the gauge group symmetry. Our study is based on a general general formula: quantum matter particle has a tau field. This equation is explicitly and explicitly applied to the ground state solution. The exact solution is the one where matter is bound to vanish from the horizon. 
We report the results of our numerical simulations of the development of a dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld model. The orbital motion of a large test particle is determined by the radius of the test particle. The tilt of the dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati test particle is governed by the action of the Bardeen-Hawking moment. This gives rise to a complete contraction of the orbital motion of the test particle, thereby moving from zero to another value of the test particle mass. The result shows a substantial relaxation of the orbital motion of the test particle. 
We derive a new version of the one-loop effective action in phi^4 theory coupled non-linear with curvature power and dynamical origin of cosmological constant with a single Galileon-like approximation of the strong energy equation. It leads to the first observational method of realizing a Galileon-like evolution. We show that such a Galileon-like mode has a dynamical origin with a special dependence of the evolution of the amplitude of fluctuations on the equation of state parameter. A difference of the internal value of the Galileon-like action is introduced and the evolution starts to continue up to redshift $z\sim 6$, where the value of the Galileon-like action can be directly identified with a local behavior that becomes apparent when one tries to solve a wide general problem for the final model with a given mass. Furthermore, we use the empirical techniques to show that if $m \gtrsim 10^{-4}$ GeV the most natural and the most natural Galileon-like action can be found. However, our present limits on the Galileon-like action are almost finite and the derived values of the matter power spectra significantly differ from those obtained for cosmological steady state. 
Using numerical simulations, we investigate the dependence of acceleration on the cosmological parameters and the equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ and on the cosmological constant $n_{\rm eff}$. Both the numerical and the spatial correlation function of a given galaxy cluster are calculated. We compare these results with results obtained in a standard formula for the expansion history. In order to calculate the acceleration dependence for a given given cluster model, we first assume the cosmological constant $n_{\rm eff}$, which we assume to be in the range 0 < w < 1 at redshift $z = 0.31$. By adopting a simple model for the non-linear gravitational energy density evolution, we have compared these results with those obtained by evolution analysis, starting with a simple Lagrangian universe in which dark energy was constrained and cosmological constant was defined by dark energy in a homogeneous way. We show that the model and the evolution performed agree in the energy range 0 < w < 1 at $z = 0.3$. Also, we found that the cosmological constant $n_{\rm eff}$ is constant with redshift at the $z = 0.3 - 1$ level, but when $\n_{\rm eff}$ increases, the value $\w_{\rm eff}$ increases sharply to very high values, $n_{\rm eff} \sim -6.5\times 10^{19}\ {\rm erg}$. We have also compared our results with results derived in other methods. Our results confirm that in the literature, only the formula of $w_{\rm eff}$ and cosmological constant $n_{\rm eff}$ is compatible at the $z = 0.3 - 1$ level. 
Perturbative relativistic model of slowly rotating neutron stars is presented. The scalar field is taken to be the same force field in Fermi model. The equation of state for two neutron stars is obtained by combining Higgs field to get approximate Newtonian field equations. The de Broglie phase angle obtained for the model neutron stars is given. 
The LISA experiment, one of the three main part of the Advanced LIGO array, will provide the first redshift measurements of the gravitational waves coming from the extragalactic background light. In this work, the goal is to perform an independent determination of the gravitational wave background with the proposed mission LISA and perform a deep description of the source-tracking strategy as well as the detector sensitivity. The LISA instrument and detector network infrastructure will be designed with the following requirements: a strong, two-component design that allows for both cold and warm absorber cores, fast detector response and scale-free integration of the optimal beam, and a low complexity of the detector and beam design. The contribution of individual components such as data combiners will be examined in a detail, providing a detailed evaluation of the contribution of each component as well as information on the standard deviation of the error metric. In this paper, we describe the data reduction pipeline developed by the instrument and detector network, describing the data reduction process, including the collimator performance, the wavefront distortion, data conversion and integration of wavefront peaks, and detector response. We describe the various detector interfaces to provide data reduction with a conservative correction of the integration noise in the observing window and we compare the performance of the expected noise level with the RMS noise. The detector network will be built with a model-independent gain matrix and optimized to observe the signal coming from the Galactic center, using a variety of feed nodes and stand-alone detectors with the idea of being cross-connected with existing LIGO detectors. A novel demonstration program will be conducted with the prototype camera used in the observation from 1 to 23 GHz in order to obtain full resolution images of the Galactic background and to identify possible sources of gravitational waves. 
If the fluid sphere evolves continuously with an increasing density, the field equations of gravity will depend on the expansion history. One can find the fluctuations in the field equations of gravity that accompany fluctuations of the density distribution in the fluid sphere. Recently, the Vlasov-Lidov (VL) equation was proposed as an efficient method to investigate the stability of the fluid field and its stability during inflation, as well as during the phase transition of the fluid and matter (which happens to be between the new and first generation matter). The Vlasov-Lidov equations have been shown to work well even when the expansion history of the fluid starts with a cosmological constant. In this paper, we apply the Vlasov-Lidov equations to investigate the problem of stability of the fluid field in the presence of a cosmological constant. We show that the instability of the fluid field during the phase transition of the fluid and matter (which happens to be between the new and first generation matter) is determined by the radial coordinate of the transition fluid, which is a function of the mean density of the sphere. The instability is described by the same quantity $N^{a_s}$ which also depends on the expansion history of the fluid, in a special manner. The most stable regions of the equations have an $N\simeq 0.01-0.01$. We present a method to calculate the stability of the fluid field in the presence of a cosmological constant. 
We study the response of a modern interferometer for a stochastic background of tensor perturbations. The perturbation initial equation of state for a large scalar radiation field is presented, with an adiabatic modification. The response is based on the spatially averaged Gaussian gradient of the background background. The formalism for the profile fitting is applied to predict the stochasticness of the background perturbation. Considering the following realistic choice of a cutoff and matching theoretical predictions: the cross section along the line of sight is tensor perturbations are then generated, by analogy with the scalar contributions, while the blackbody contribution dominates over both. The detector response is tested numerically on the problem of stochastic background due to a stochastic population of sources, which increases the parameter space of our model. A change in the signal-to-noise ratio due to the choice of the cutoff is found to be important in the detection limit for single mode of interferometry. The results suggest that large scale signals may not be detected on the current and future timescales without the use of precision independent measurements. 
Non-stationary constraints on fundamental equations of state of the gravitationally unstable neutron stars (MGNS) were obtained with data on the $B$-band linear spectrum from $10^{10}$ to $10^{11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ produced by three of the most distant hypermassive binary neutron stars, I~B~D. This pulsar's observed pulsed spectrum displays stellar morphology in both the polar and transverse hemispheres, which are normally interpreted as due to magnetic fields. These stars have strong anomalously large, $B\gtrsim 10^{15}$ G, magnetic dipole moment and circular magnetic field components, also known as "hypothetical neutron stars". These observations raise interesting questions on the neutron star population and its potential sources in galaxy groups and even clusters of galaxies. We propose that we can use such neutron stars to constrain the $H_0$-driven "P_h$-induced star formation rate $\sigma_{iso}$, its energy dependence, the $k$-dependent number of $G$-metallicity progenitors and the parameter of the hypermassive binary population. The relative importance of these ideas and the range of possibilities can be used to address issues of astrophysics and astrophysics beyond neutron star physics and to probe a wide range of parameters. 
The energy density is non-localized and it depends on a primordial density field. In a heuristic treatment of inflation, the scale factor is described as a cosmological constant, known as the scale invariant. As a result of such cosmological constant, the energy density has a size that can vary substantially and a short time scale is associated with it. This potential can be obtained in a simple but regular way if the inflaton decays in the finite time. When such decay is slow, there is a rapid "bubble" arising from the decay of the inflaton, and this bubble oscillates and inflates as a result of time-reparametrization. There is no need to specify a temporal horizon for such inflation to take place. 
In the context of theories of the early universe, Chaplygin gas provides a natural reservoir for dark matter in the outer parts of the Universe. However, this theory has been modified on a substantial scale by a non-adiabatic pressure perturbation, or nfVFP, that affects bulk motions of the dark matter within the pressure boundary and affect large scale structure. We show that this nfVFP creates a modest thermally thick chaperone, which causes not only the quasi-standard velocity in the circumgalactic medium, but also large-scale magnetic fields as well. In addition, the pressure over the gaseous part of the intracluster medium, in contrast to conventional spherical consistency, causes strong non-adiabatic perturbations, which may dominate in the outer parts of the Universe. Our result is in agreement with earlier theoretical findings, and supports the possibility that chapsonic gas might be a promising reservoir for dark matter. 
The recently published analytic models of halo cosmologies are well suited to explain general equilibrium-like models, where the unphysicality of the scalar potential of an axisymmetric scalar field is assumed. But, in order to reproduce models with self-interacting axisymmetric models, this model must have nonphysical symmetry. Here we extend the special treatment of nonholonomic deformations to higher order, for which the system is self-interacting. We adopt the simple symplectic general relativistic ansatz, presented in Bahcall et al. (2012), and reconstruct the nonholonomic invariance between axial or circular coordinates. We do not use the formalism previously introduced by Dhunmaro & Del Zona (2003) in order to improve the study of symmetry. When we consider the extra dimension gravity, the solutions of the Einstein-Newton equations are consistent with nonhalo trajectories without deviations from general relativity. Interestingly, no such deviation comes when rotating or circular orbits are assumed in addition to regular orbits. We test these results on low-mass halos and find that a solution of the Einstein-Newton equations is impossible. On the other hand, we find no significant deviation from general relativity. We also extend the analytic solutions to higher order for comparison with corresponding solutions for Einstein's spacetime of lower mass halos and find that the bispectrum describing each of these geodesics is only marginally compatible with general relativity. 
The Huygens principle is an elementary principle for cosmology, in which the matter in the metric and energy sectors are universal, but the parameters such that matter scalar and scalar-tensor are not included. The Standard Model provides a natural expression for this cosmological constant, which makes Huygens an excellent probe for the natural scalar-tensor theory of gravity and gauge cosmology. The Huygens formula can be approximated using the Standard Model of particle physics (SPPhysics) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We derive Huygens probability distribution functions for the mass functions of black hole binary black holes, photon power spectra, gravitational wave (GW) detections, normalization functions, and decoupling. We provide empirical formulas for three equations for the amplitude and shape of gravitational waves and the cosmic microwave background fluctuations. We have generalized the equations to covariant cosmological models and compare the Huygens probability distribution functions with those of $\Lambda CDM$ and the $\Lambda CDM$ gravity models. We show that this effect may exist, but may not be resolved. 
We present a method to study the potential density configuration of a system in an axisymmetric configuration as a function of the scalar field in a Schwarzschild-Mann-Mantle metric, and explore the impact of the growth of the system on the impact of the scalar field on the dynamics of the system. We find that the system may not be stable but instead show that the scalar field evolution can affect the shape of the potential density. For a typical axisymmetric potential, this is achieved by perturbing the potential with the perturbation terms. However, for a simplified model where the density vector is generic and the scalar field does not exist, it is shown that this growth produces a very small expected mean potential density of the system. For the case where both the scalar field and the axial vector have the same initial density and the scalar field is real, then the growth of the system cannot be halted and its dynamics becomes fundamentally different from what happens in an astrophysical model with the two fields initially singular. We further show that this effect is due to the axial vector growing quickly in order to sustain the dark matter halos on the two axes (i.e., a quantum singularity in the case where the dark matter halos have a tau constant). Our method provides a quantitative way to distinguish between axisymmetric models that can be explored in an axisymmetric potential, and those where the axial vector and the scalar fields are real. The prediction of the method and its application to the toy model scenario in our simulation are also discussed. 
We perform a general analysis of the macroscopic gravity equations, motivated by a study in small system configurations. We compute for the first time in a `pre-dimensions' generalization of the Bekenstein-Leibniz equations with the elements of the cosmological constant, the Einstein-de Sitter potential and the Einstein-Pfitter potential, an extended contribution of the constant for cosmological perturbations. The two-point problem of Bekenstein-Leibniz potential is evaluated as well as various theoretical issues for its application in both Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and CMB. The considered solutions, when compared with the numerical solutions obtained in other circumstances, generally lead to a quite satisfactory solution, as well as some interesting but problematic equations. 
We study a group of Einstein-inspired relativistic solutions of Newtonian gravity, coupled to the effects of dark energy, as well as the effects of dark matter and the corresponding properties on the dynamics of systems of cosmological objects. We investigate their contributions to the peculiar velocity distribution and the evolution of perturbations at cosmological scales. We then perform a statistical analysis of such solutions to investigate, and also as a probe of the physical parameters of the systems, the link between their solutions and the dynamics of the central objects. 
We present a modified version of the standard theory for galactic evolution of dark matter haloes as they migrate from their cores to the Milky Way. The theory generalises the usual black hole and dark matter mass function for haloes containing a primary component. The results of simulations are extended to higher mass haloes and use the most recent stellar evolution data to predict the mass density profile and the dispersion relation for haloes of different mass and stellar mass components. In particular, we find that the H$_{12}$DM-thickness and $N_{H}$-$\sigma_8$ data haloes $m_{h}\sim 0.15-0.23 $M_{\odot}$ are compatible with the present halo stellar mass for dark matter masses comparable to $10^{10}$ M_{\odot}$. The empirical cosmological parameters of the models are closely consistent with the results obtained for the stellar mass functions obtained in previous work. Moreover, we also find that the halo mass function has negative slope for various mass components, whereas the stellar mass function has a positive slope for a range of initial densities ($m_e$, $n_{h}\sim1-2$). The predictions are not affected by fluctuations in the stellar masses of individual galaxies that alter the gas fraction in the central regions. 
We explore the scenario of a given hierarchy of dark energy models in which every field in the hierarchy traces a same fundamental physical phenomenon. We analyse the phenomenology of each theory, the Einstein field equations and the running of the matter energy density and energy density with the sum of the couplings. We study the necessary dynamical evolution and compare it with the conditions for creation of the universe. We propose and analyze possible physical phenomenology that connects different theories in an integration-like manner and suggest new methods for distinguishing different models. We also discuss the possible cosmological origin of the so-called "dark web", i.e. the dark sectors, i.e. unassociated objects. 
The possibility of future GRB is looked forward to. The standard experimentes of GRB experiment suffers from a distortion of the running direction at the early horizon. But in quantum cosmology, acceleration begins very late and may lead to a permanent distortion of the running direction in late time. This result leads to the wormhole model and double portal model of GRB. If GRB is a young and intense event, it is hardly recovered after the wormhole period even at present. The fact that the GRB duration is not larger than about five minutes is not important for large volume quantum corrections. In particular, the imprint of large volume quantum corrections on GRB duration is too small at present to be a cause for the Hawking problem. We analyze the effects of these quantum corrections on the GRB dynamics and demonstrate that it appears for Hawking radiation. 
We calculate the running of the spectral index and the proportionality of scalar anisotropies in the standard scalar field model with respect to the baryon acoustic oscillations at 95% CL in the context of the full Einstein-Hilbert potential in perturbation theory. For the case of baryon acoustic oscillations we find the running to be small and much higher than those obtained by the full nulling on horizon detection of the matter power spectrum. On the other hand, we find a running of the spectral index and a significant parameter difference between curvature perturbations and isocurvature modes. 
The ringing wormholes are those outstanding wormholes where gravity is modulated in a pattern suitable to describe the dynamics of the Universe. The communication between wormholes is usually carried out through the dark sector with the potentials of dark energy and the primordial non-Gaussianity. This points to a link between the pattern speed and the pulsation velocity. Moreover, the primordial gravitational wave power spectrum is interpreted as being a part of the ringing wormhole pattern speed. These attributes of the ring and the quark gap are implications of quantum correlations in the past history of the Universe and an analog to the Dark Energy Theory. Here we study the possible connection with the lagging wormholes, assuming that the dark energy possesses a phantom energy field. We first develop a phenomenological method based on the static solutions of gravitational gravitational equations and then analyze the possibility of overcoming this relation by testing the Einstein gravity theory with a strongly coupled instability of the vacuum dark matter sector, which may have negative gravitational waves signature. For a wide class of high-mass quark gaps such as the ring, with superdensity potentials and strong non-Gaussianity, and with a window to the measured pulsation velocity of the universe, the combination of these ingredients could make a very direct connection to the structure of the Dark Energy and the Quantum Cosmology. Finally, we discuss its importance as a benchmark method for the current generation of quantum gravitational wave detectors. 
We consider relativistic effects which cause motion of relativistic particles in a vacuum at the equatorial plane of the Galaxy. In general relativistic particles are spatially coupled with the galactic magnetic field, making the latter quasi-spherical, due to the importance of the azimuthal order in the equatorial plane of the Galaxy. We compute the adiabatic motion of a fully relativistic particle, that depends on the stellar velocity, as well as on the velocity profile in the Galactic plane. At present, these two quantities are one and the same, meaning that relativistic particles with $\delta M \sim 10^{17}$ km/s are not a generic class of particles, since the temperature of the Galaxy is not such that they can be spatially correlated. However, the action of such particles and the system dynamics of the diffuse $\delta$ M may be affected if they travel off the geometrical thin disk. In addition, relativistic particles have the possibility of being trapped near the Milky Way, where a magnetic field carries them away, which makes the intergalactic magnetic field steeper than current interstellar lines of sight. 
We propose a new closed cosmology with two scalar field components, one in the lens field and the other as an inverse transformation of the shear. The lens-reward potential in the model is composed of two operators: a helicity and an expansion. The helicity proceeds exponentially in the linear terms of the lensed spacetime and the expansion scales linearly with the helicity so that the lens galaxy behaves in the Kasner spacetime as the canonical bispectrum. In the Robertson-Walker cosmology we have a spacetime complete with only an isotropic expansion of the galaxy in the mass-radius space. This cosmological model is consistent with the recent predictions of the expanding slow-roll quantum cosmology and with the observation that curvature perturbations on the horizon dominate the superhorizon scale fluctuations. 
Radiative transfer equations are formulated in non-Riemannian space-times, where the results for radial diffusion are calculated, and the code in which these equations are applied. The equations are generalized to any isotropic differential equation. The code in which these equations are applied is written in C++ and interprets its solution in terms of a transverse diffusion function. A calculation of the full Navier-Leibler function is performed for all the flows describing the convective zone at different radii. Results are compared with Gaussian processes of radiative transfer and the case of 'fast' radiative transfer. Our results show that more efficient geometries may well arise for non-inertial flows in non-Riemannian space-times. In particular, if a flow develops a transition with a Gaussian velocity, the results obtained are consistent with observations. With both non-inertial flows and hydrodynamical turbulence, there exist no coherent solutions. The plane-of-the-sky simulations done by our method at various radii do not predict stable solutions for the complex convective zone which connects them to simulations of fast and 'fast' geometries. 
We discuss quantisation of space-times from the regime of apparent horizon into the regime of small-horizon velocity terms that are generally called vacuum horizons. We show that such space-times are quantised by quantising their absolute significance at the phase of the metric that takes place from the Einstein point of view. The effect of these quantisations on the form of the expansion of the dark energy equation of state at the redshift of a given matter horizon has been demonstrated at large radii, and it is demonstrated to be dependent on the parameter space of the volume that contains the non-trivial potential with respect to which the metric exits. Moreover, quantisation of vacuum horizons from the vacuum space cannot exceed the critical conditions imposed on such horizons for a horizonless universe. 
A new combination of dark energy and the cosmic coincidence is introduced which offers an alternative to explicit General Relativity. A good extension of Newtonian Dynamics in the dark energy sector is required, and the combination may have to be even more effective than usual. We show that the effective dark energy equation of state can be written as the sum of the sum of the combined operators at finite cosmological scales. This and the combined coupling corrections for dark energy do not depend on any prior mass equation of state. The signal is amplified by the effective dark energy equation of state and we calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of the combination of dark energy and the cosmic coincidence. We derive the relation between cosmological precision and the difference between the dark energy equation of state and that found in the general relativity scenario. We compare the result to several known cosmic CMB data and conclude that it agrees well with those calculated by direct calculation of the data obtained from galaxy surveys. We also briefly discuss some applications of the combination of dark energy and the cosmic coincidence for nonrelativistic dark energy models. 
We study in detail the quantum cosmological models with and without explicit local de-Sitter states, if they were formulated with local de Sitter-states at the beginning of their evolution as early de Sitter or after their initial de Sitter phases, or have their initial values dramatically diverged into a state where their counterparts are also primordial. By using the results of previous studies of the Bianchi I loop quantum cosmology and describing them in a purely Newtonian framework, we show that the effects of scalar field and neutrino dark matter can be effectively and directly recovered by introducing local de Sitter states. The slow roll approximation in these models leads to solutions that have vanishing rates of the particles occurring in the vacuum, corresponding to early de Sitter regimes that will eventually become ultrarelativistic, in accordance with cosmological observations. Finally, we show that the corresponding ultrarelativistic de Sitter states would lead to non-zero stochastic evolution in the universe after their initial de Sitter phases. 
We study the isotropic graviton in the CMB anisotropies in two-point correlation functions $(\Omega_0 \rightarrow m_t_{h}/m_t_{tb} \rightarrow m_t_{c})$ at $2\times 1$ the angle $r$. We also derive the kinetic-velocity coupling and perform a large-scale analysis. In the absence of $m_t_{t}/m_t_{tb}$ or $r^*$ the covariance problem becomes irrelevant. In contrast, in the presence of an anisotropic gravity, the oscillation of $m_t_a$ is reduced from its linearity to the isotropic one and the coupling invariance is violated even for a conformal scalar graviton. 
We explore the possibility of renormalizable future cosmologies in a string coupled to an inflationary universe. Our focus is on the inner bound on the Hubble rate at which an inflationary inflationary era should take place, as shown by a spherically symmetric gauge field in a slow roll gravitational potential. In particular, we consider the situation in which the matter density is inversely proportional to the Hubble rate, i.e., asymptotically a quintessence field in the gravity quintessence sector can be confined to the outer bound at most four times its horizon. We focus on the term of this quartessence field in the baryogenesis epoch, to which we refer. We find that in the vicinity of the string quintessence field, the potential behaves as a squeezed quintessence potential in the $\gamma$-vector direction, whereas in the above configuration, the inflationary expansion never occurs. This leads to a bound $\alpha \ga \gamma$, showing that the (fast) roll inflation is ultimately accompanied by a $\gamma$-tension dominated era. On the other hand, the weak coupling with the string quintessence could lead to a slightly softer potential in general relativity. We confirm that the existence of such a bound is possible, even for the scenario of slow roll and/or quintessence inflation which should not arise in that scenario. We speculate that it could lead to observable signatures in the current early Universe such as the growth of the dark matter density and the black hole mass density on the order of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy function. 
It has been proposed that we obtain the triad operators in terms of circular solutions in the vacuum space. Here we show that even in this model, the triad operators can be bounded in terms of two double solutions, one of which is a true (in the fourth corner of the metric), another one is pure (in the fifth corner of the metric), and the third one is fixed (in the sixth corner of the metric). However, because of the spherical coupling of the triad operators, there are no empty orbits in the whole field, and even so, we can always obtain the triad operators under vacuum conditions, such as quantum fluctuations. 
Inflation and inflationary theories can produce stable universes with $f_a \gtrsim -1$ and $f_b \gtrsim 1$, with the expected baryonic mass distribution depending on the geometry. In the context of cosmological observations, these theories may appear to have the freedom to produce the observed universe. We examine whether such models are in conflict with the standard model predictions by assuming that inflation is effective at fixed initial conditions. In particular, we employ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) formalism to investigate the weak lensing relation for real and simulated Lyapunov cosmological objects. We find that the observed LambdaCDM density profile is consistent with the observed FLRW and the implied non-linear power spectrum in the lensing radius region is well correlated with the cosmological redshift, regardless of the model. As an example, we find that, although the formation and evolution of the Universe are still qualitatively different, the relation between density and cosmological parameters depends very closely on the cosmological parameters, which could rule out the scenario in which the cosmic expansion occurred very early. 
Three fundamental energy conditions are considered: (1) energy requirements for energyless to hydrogen models, (2) transition temperature, and (3) minimum separation between self-interacting protons and helium. These energy condition depend on the injection time for hydrogen through the solar wind, the rate of rotation during each mass transfer event and the total mass loss rate of the core. 
We derive a powerful framework for constructing models of accelerating dark energy. We use this framework to study the cosmological interaction of Dark Energy and cosmological equations of state (EoSs). We illustrate how in each of the four EoSs, we deduce which dark energy and cosmological equations of state are imposed as input constraints. In particular, we investigate models in which the EoSs with standard errors increase as dark energy exits the Big Rip and initial conditions for inflation evolve. We perform an accurate and quantitative calculation of this evolution, including fitting parameters, prior data, fitting power spectrum, and numerical models. For a given model, the power spectrum and posterior correlation functions are recovered for both metric and scalar quintessence models as well as models with flat eigenstates with anisotropic potentials. We find that when the EoSs with standard errors approach a "true" tension between the quintessence model and the observable observables, the corrections for such models may exceed the observational bounds. Moreover, we find that standard EoSs of varying shape and density can lead to too large scales for inflation models to make significant contributions to the observed $E_{\rm obs}$ and the cosmological parameter values by 30% or more. It is also shown that models with slightly larger initial densities ($\geq 5$ $GeV$) tend to overproduce the observable values. To assess the impact of the combination of EoS selection, exclusion and assumption bias, we use these to produce a model of an induced modified Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology (Mrk 231). 
Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQCC) is an expanding universe consisting of a constant equation of state, leading to an extraordinary fact. Like Einstein's Theory, it implies universal coordinates for the initial conditions. Both the initial configuration and the evolution can be distinguished within a unified scheme. The original formulation in the paper by Shafranov (2011) uses the conservation equation (CD) to estimate the value of the Cessation, but new terms have been added that provide the cold-equilibrium state and rotation states. However, we show that the resulting CD formula has an exact form that is exactly equivalent to Einstein's approach. 
I discuss the ability of small and large higher-order forces on the density field of the fluid inflaton (of the form k_a = \cos - \pi^{\alpha}/d^2) to enhance the stability of a field and thereby attract spontaneously singularities. The dynamics of such an SU(2) field can be taken into account directly by using Fokker-Planck type equations and the energy conditions of a small field. Hence, the force pattern is very special. The interaction term of such SU(2) field with other field couples to the fluid being in a potential and enters the potential. Therefore, there exist vanishing extra SU(2) field couples to the fluid and it does not return to the field; however, the field couples to \cos and has a coupling at \cos(radii) and \cos(radii+1). These interactions appear at the time of the scalar-tensor particle breaking in order to improve the stability of the field. In the limit that the oscillation frequency is large, the gravitational spectrum of the field obtained as a result of the interactions becomes a very strong power-law (d \gtrsim 1/\alpha) with no nonlinear decay. With the existence of superpotential and associated nontrivial perturbations, the terms of density field on the large field become suppressed for smaller tensor powers of mass. It is then shown that the tensor modes of the field become stable and eventually decelerate. 
To study the properties of quasi-spherical objects we extend to the 3-dimensional models of rotating stationary halos. The class of solutions can be represented by the proper solution in the relativistic limit, and allows us to study the effects of the relativistic forces on the matter, for example the following. The resulting models are well fit to the data: for gas with a large dust grain size for example the RTOCM model and the \cite{ALcock18} case. 
We investigate the framework of numerical relativity in the adiabatic regime in which multiple singularities are aligned against each other in the presence of a static background. In such a case the angular momentum ratio, assuming two density modes of arbitrarily small mass, is mainly proportional to the total time of angular momentum accretion and to the epoch of spatial expansion (the Galactic bulge cutoff). As a demonstration we compute the distribution function of the contribution of massive particles to the gravitational wave emission from a given line of sight in three dimensions in the adiabatic regime. The difference is found to be generally significant. 
To date no light signature of pulsars from bright stars has been identified. Observations from nearby pulsars are conducted to search for pulsars that could be detected, identifying targets for future studies. The proposed search involves searching for soft X-ray counterparts to gravitational waves from pulsars by exploiting pulsar timing noise in radio frequency. The search may be successful with sensitivity on the order of microJy in pulsar frequency, compared to a detection on the order of $\sim$6 microJy for the other targets. Future pulsar searches should reveal new pulsars with no detectable radio signals from pulsars beyond ~10 GeV. 
We study the influence of the mass-loss rates induced by the multiphase plasma on the formation and properties of the interstellar medium and compare the results with observations. We point out that the effects of the thermodynamic equilibrium are smaller than those derived by Kazriner and Richardson. The dependence of the protostellar mass on the initial metallicity at low galactocentric radii is a new function of the mass-loss rate which has never been used before. The surface density for which this relation is obtained depends on the ambient gas in the UV-bright Galactic disk. 
We study the dynamics of extended closed inflationary models with scalar and tensor perturbations that occur in a range of degrees of freedom that do not include the standard model constant $w$. The additional mass term, however, acts independently of the initial perturbation. In this case the existence of an extra variable points to an energy term at the short time scales. We assume that such cosmological models will become localised when $z\sim 1$ and calculate the observed fraction of accelerated expansion of the universe. The resulting vacuum energy density is M_{H}/n = -20(+11)^(-9) \ln \sigma_8, where \sigma_8 is the Hubble parameter, and \sigma_8 is the Hubble constant. The result is valid, for various cosmological parameter conditions and high-field geometries, up to the end of the inflationary epoch. The duration of the reheating period is small, in the sense that inflation follows only close to the maximum reheating efficiency. The limit on the neutrino mass fraction depends on the initial spatial expansion velocity, $v_s$, as well as on $w$, but the statistical consistency of our results with observations is also significantly improved. 
A method for analytical expression of the $E^{-\alpha}$ distribution function is derived. The approximation is shown that the initial (down-going) negative entropy for dark matter depends on both the $E^{-\alpha}$ energy density of scalar field and the momentum mass of scalar field. 
In this work we investigate the holographic theory of general relativity, its potential relation to geometry, and its application to early universe, the Planck cosmic microwave background, and its potential relations to the annihilation density and its period ratio. We describe the complete geometry, density-range and period relation of the holographic theory and the non-commutativity, the curvature, mass, and effective energy. We first emphasize the details of the fields and of the initial conditions and discuss their dependence on the critical value of the non-commutativity. Then, we study the possibility of using the general theory to derive the early universe cosmological parameters such as the Higgs mass and scale height. We propose two holographic equations to explain these relations, namely, the holographic perfect fluid, the phantom fluid and the holographic scalar metric. We calculate the available initial conditions for these equation sets and show that the holographic theory can reproduce the phenomenology and a well-known time dependent amplitude of the early universe power spectrum. Our results reinforce the origin of both the non-commutativity and the holographic theory. 
The motion of spiral galaxies in projection on large scales is known to cause deviations from spherical symmetry. Here, we explore an alternative solution based on anisotropic Hubble expansion from cosmological expansion. We show that in this expansion, the energy density of the system is relatively small for scales similar to its Hubble constant ($a_{\rm eq}$). It is confirmed that when $a_{\rm eq}=0$ the local power density peaks (diameter radii) are finite. To account for the observed D'Errico effect the effective adiabatic function of the Hubble expansion is significantly increased. We show that for the model with the initial velocity dependence of the initial equation of state (EOS) and its triaxiality ratio $Q_{\rm eq}$, the apertures for the background-galaxy and the spatial volume distributions are consistent with the observations. The rate and shape of the Sigma relation in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) are strongly suppressed, and its degree of dependence on the Planck redshift (assuming constant Hubble expansion rate) is of the order of the $Q_{\rm eq}$. 
We investigate possible dual interacting cosmologies, including late accelerated expansion and phase transitions. Several models with kinetic mixing of two particles are considered, with the mean Higgs field within a few GeV, and coupled to the photons via proton repulsion or an admixture of the collective radiation. The impact of the different contributions on the final phases is discussed. Within each case, we discuss the possible quantum requirements for any interaction mechanism in the early universe, using both the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the early extragalactic cosmic microwave background radiation. The interpretation of these results in a framework based on modified gravity is also considered, also including dark energy. 
The fluctuating length scale of the solar system, namely the lagrangian of the cosmological constant (L), is studied using a linear Lagrangian of the recently developed Leibniz-Davies vector field equations in an electron-ion-hydrogen doublet scheme. The standard helical-universal-particle-driven-cell(S3) approach (SG) and SPDM (which the \textit{LAP} experiment find the main criterion to explain the observed lagrangian) are used as the method to calculate the Lagrangian for particle-driving magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) supernovae (SNe) with different spin periods, as well as the emergence of buoyant bodies in 3D spacetime. The full set of simulations reveals a large variety of hydrodynamic solutions that lead to a tachyon-like acceleration of large scale structure during supernova explosions and to their subsequent structure collapse. The analytic interpretation of these simulations thus implies that the Lagrangian behaves quite differently during the evolution of objects, even at low mass scales. The divergence of the corresponding scale of the SMC evolves in $n \sim 1-4$ depending on the geometry of the medium at the explosion site, while its evolution toward a Lagrangian of the two-dimensional space field and toward a $\mathcal{L}_V \geq \mathcal{L_V}$ scale vary between galaxy to galaxy, corresponding to the amplitude of the $\mathcal{L}_V$ scale during supernova explosions. 
We derive a general theory for cosmological perturbations in string systems consisting of a short-range $B \rightarrow G$ scalar field coupled to gravity. The perturbations are charged and counterpart to the second-order effective field equations, constituting both a theory of general relativity and a vector graviton model. We show that the gauge invariant effect on the power spectrum of matter perturbations induces the formation of powerful massless operators that are a few orders of magnitude stronger than those seen in standard scalar field theories. This is the first direct observational evidence for a sizeable supersymmetric power spectrum in massive scalar fields, with a tension with the standard model expectations. 
The case of the new Earth gravity model EIGEN-CG03C allows us to constrain the amplitude of the gravitational lensing observed by the Lense-Thirring effect at a level comparable to that of the standard deviation (${\rm M_{LSE}} \sim 4$ km/s). We perform a full N-body code including Bayesian inference and systematic uncertainties to obtain statistical bounds for the Lense-Thirring effect amplitude. We also include the Lense-Thirring effect uncertainties for the case of an exoplanet host star, solar system and $i$-axis origin. We do not find significant differences between the Gaia based and other prior measurements on the mass of a planet as inferred from the new Earth gravity model. The Jupiter mass inferred from the Lense-Thirring effect upper bound on $M_{jup} \ge 10^6$ solar masses is compatible with the Earth mass, which is lower than the case of the existing Earth gravity model. Thus, the measurement of $m_{Jup}$ by the Lense-Thirring effect can be applied for the study of the $m_{jup}$ of very massive planets with Jupiter masses around the Sun and a low mass interior and systematics present in the current Earth gravity model. We find that the method we describe to provide further constraints on the amplitude of the gravitational lensing effect is able to produce precision measurements of $m_{Jup}$ at $k \ge 10^4$ km/s and the $m_{jup}$ of Earth around Jupiter, which could offer a deeper understanding of the Lense-Thirring effect at $k \ge 10^5$ km/s. 
A solution to the cosmological constant problem needs to be quantified in the framework of general relativity, with an accurate and robust derivation of gravity's surface parameters. When dealing with transiting extrasolar planets, physical properties can be modified by gravitational perturbations. Here, we show that the black hole HESS J180821+5855, the transiting planet HD209458b, exhibits strong gravitational instability with an orbital period of about 0.027 hr. In the course of this gravitational instability, a thin stellar disk reaches an orbital separation of about 20 au from the star. This ``hidden'' structure will eventually reveal a number of observable features on the parsec-scale. 
The geometry of two-dimensional perturbations in the high-frequency domain is considered. In particular, considering spherical modes on large scales and compact cylindrical spacetime, two-dimensional perturbations of gravity have potentials, which is, for example, finite by scale factor. In order to study the trajectories of stationary and perturbed systems in this way, perturbations of different degrees of freedom are computed, taking into account the perturbation phase. These degrees of freedom vary with angular momentum in space, in time and in a perturbed domain. The sphere-wave gravitational equations are solved numerically, including the perturbation phase effects. The stability of perturbations is then investigated. The latter are found to be dependently on the phase of the perturbations. In general, the difference between perturbation phases and the perturbation length can be regarded as an analytical result. As a result, the stability of perturbations are more strongly constrained for larger perturbations. The stability of these perturbations is found to be strongly dependent on the initial perturbation amplitude. At the same time, the stability of perturbations of different degrees of freedom are found to depend strongly on the mass-radius relation for the cases where all the perturbations are equal. 
The initial conditions of quantum gravity depend on the exact quantum number of frames formed. Motivated by the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations I show that quantum-gravity theories with M$_c = $m^\theta$ can accommodate any finite Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Motivated by the properties of the Standard Model Type Ia supernovae I analyze inflationary perturbations that accompany BAO-driven winds. The corresponding signature of a canonical inflationary cosmology is determined by the number of BAO degrees of freedom that are generated during inflation. This suggests that the canonical inflationary perturbation signature may be described by a broken power-law. 
We study the possibility of finding a coincidence of our observed distribution of cosmological parameters with our corresponding statistical estimates of the coincidence signal. We first quantify the variations in the degree of likelihood that can be identified in a likelihood analysis with existing data and discuss the consequences of such a profile. This probability is then re-simulated in the context of the spectral index relation of the early universe. We show that the combination of S\'ersic and statistical statistics can reveal the flatness of the observed correlation for a wide range of parameter values. The reduction in the likelihood reduces the significance of the very large redshift scale relative to the standard cosmological model and is therefore likely to point to the existence of an interpretation as a recent type of cosmic coincidence. The likelihood improvement would increase the evidence for the existence of such a coincidence for even more parameters. 
The inflationary Universe is well known in the Einstein Era of cosmology but has not been comprehensively explained because its slow-roll method has been assumed to predict the formation of primordial magnetic fields. In this article we study the non-ideal scenario where inflaton field relaxes non-equilibrium. We formulate and model non-linear equations, based on a statistical theory, for inhomogeneous dark matter density field under the simple assumption of flat scalar field. Taking into account two big physical problems, spatial curvature perturbation and one of the existence of Higgs bosons, we perform an order of magnitude improvement on a number of axion-like models with NMB curvature perturbation generated by single-field inflation. In our model, the dynamics of the inflationary Universe is dominated by vacuum and dust dynamics, while the details of its phenomenology are perturbed by the observed cosmological observables. Moreover, the formation of low-energy photons from those hot dark matter particles and other particles is related to the functional form of the induced tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ which we study. A large complement of independent scale invariant Sachs-Wolfe profiles are obtained, including the growth rate of density perturbations and of dust dynamics. We predict the time evolution of the observable quantities such as effective temperature, Brans-Dicke moment, electron temperature, viscosity parameter, electron spectrum and the opacity level. 
A single physical term of inflation, being its perturbation, is assumed to have finite values and cosmological parameters. The resulting $f(R)$ scenario consists in the inflaton non-zero couplings, with an observable leptonic term in front of the pre-inflationary matter. This conformal property of an inflaton is explicitly referred to as the \hpsonic term. The breaking of this \hpsonic term leads to an $f(R)$ multipole variation in the fluctuation power spectrum, which differs from that of the WMAP3 data. The coupled $f(R)$ models imply different constraints on gravity at large scales, but these are weaker than those of current observations. 
We calculate the post-Newtonian constraints on the (1+z) Lagrangian M-form f(R) in the Palatini formalism, where 1 is the expansion of the Lagrangian of the universe (and gives a one-point value of the dipole beta) and the other is a fluctuation term. By modifying the FSRW formalism to take the FSRW background, we reduce the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) corrections to Gauss's f(R) and get a cosmological linearization with a nonlinear density profile (known as the Gauss-de Sitter flat-sky universe model). As a result, we obtain analytical expressions for the (1+z) Lagrangian in this model, the exponential fluctuations, the density profiles and the Hubble parameter ($\Omega_{\rm h}$) in terms of the nonlinear coupling constants. We also find two parts of the spectral energy distribution, with the flat ones being best approximated by an M$_{\rm sp\chi}$-type power spectrum and the spheroidal ones a power law. 
We consider the astrophysical implications of the hypothesis that globular clusters (GCs) assemble in a certain time and morphological formation is driven by the dynamical or gravitational forces. This leads to a set of calculable flows of matter: the lightest globular clusters (LGB) have different radii, distributions of masses, and velocity dispersions. In our model, all the constituent stars in the GCs form a single object, because this object is dense and makes it possible to occupy long enough timescales to form a binary. The model is able to produce observational signatures which, when combined with local spiral effects, can then be used to constrain the luminosity distances of known GCs. We investigate the gravitational lensing of LGB clusters in the halo context and show that it is very likely that our model is an example of gravitational lensing of a GC. It is found that in general, the gravitational magnification of the LGBs causes their radii and mass distribution to be strongly enhanced, while it generally produces offset or dim spots in their motion. 
The investigation of finite-momentum solutions of Einstein's field equations has emphasized that, the extension of Einstein's field equations to higher dimensions does not permit to create simple solutions of a static scalar field in some possible way. We analyze these solutions in the frame of Majumdar-Papapetrou in a big-world numerical approach and verify that their absence can be explained using approximate solutions of the Einstein equations. By assuming that the order of non-linear integration leads to solutions in some approximation that are right-handed, we show that such solutions, which can in principle be written as second-order conformal formulas, could also be written in some approximation with additional second-order conformal formula. In fact, we obtained a simple consistency relation for this family of solutions. Such solution satisfies all our requirements for obtaining an exact solution of Einstein's field equations. 
We investigate the dynamical state of axisymmetric and rotating particle magnetized plasma using a novel hydrodynamic model. We develop a diagnostic diagram and study the effect of magnetorotational instability on the expansion rate, energy dissipation, and magnetic field. We show that the presence of a resonance condition at the outer boundary of the accretion flow can lead to transport of energy for a time independent, superfluid system of particles. The induced coupling leads to the formation of energetic diffusive shock waves which destabilize the plasma. This material can induce stability of magnetic field by electrostatic collisions. 
I review recent findings on the stability of dark matter modes inside standard massive holes (MHD) and how they can be tested on experiments which typically use only current data. It is found that (a) Strictly general modes with infinite spin can be stable (though at high luminosity); (b) After a certain $3 \times 10^{-4}$ mean flux density changes with luminosity, with zero luminosity modes with finite spin can be very stable; and (c) Type 1 power spectra show the flattening of spectral shape at low and very high luminosities, and in particular at low luminosities the slope of the observed B-V color in some extreme cases. 
We discuss the quantum black hole and Hawking radiation at microscopic magnifying by employing a hyperbolic and invariant quantum gravity. In particular we present the quantum black hole energy density as well as the energy density due to Hawking radiation at this wavelength. We demonstrate that it would be very powerful to realize the strong compactity obtained from the quantum black hole radiation for massive bodies. 
We propose an extension of Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity Theory that may be used to develop and test cosmological analytical models in the context of general relativity. We show that for the two scalar and tensor potentials studied we find three attractive constraints in our formulation. The squeezed flat universe, where the velocity of light is constant, is unstable, and, at least in the density limit of low-mass Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) is produced, should not yield stable equilibrium, whereas, for the long-range scalar potential with the density bump, the existence of a dynamical loop is supported. This weak-parameter constraint explains why an effective gauge parameter at the Lagrangian instanton must match the test of inflation. An alternative result of our approach is that for the case of strong gravity the gas pressure evolution results in a linear symmetry breaking of the general potential, leaving only an asymmetric gravitational potential in the squeezed approximation. These findings are tested by the main features of our theory: a Lagrangian initial condition where the phase space of matter takes the form of the Gaussian vector potential, and the late time non-Gaussianities, as well as a symmetric potential consisting of both higher and lower order terms in a scalar field theory including the non-equilibrium geometry. 
Higher order corrections to the cosmic microwave background power spectrum are expected to occur, once inflationary perturbations are introduced. In particular, the recently proposed slow-roll-like growth mode is expected to present a considerable divergence in the peak power spectrum relative to the quasi-simultaneous power spectrum arising from inflation. This model can explain a large amount of the observed trend of spectral slope which is seen at the 1sigma level, and is shown to lead to a consistent result of the average curvature-acceleration divergence of the curvature perturbations relative to the standard LCDM scenario. In particular, we investigate whether perturbations induced by a large scalar field are satisfied by a theoretical model which predicts an X-brane peak at a limit of 4.5\sigma on the scale of the scalar field. By comparing our predictions to observational constraints we suggest a natural extension of the model into larger scales. If the model holds, this result, together with constraints that do not require significant nonlinearity at large scales, provides evidence that a physical interpretation of the curvature perturbations observed by Planck and CMB experiments is feasible. 
We consider the effects of a large, strong, weakly compressible medium of mass K (M_{rot}/M_{rot}=0.1). We study the effects of the quark-neutrino coupling on the low-resolution stability of the early universe by minimizing the unabsorbed gravitational energy. We present simulations of the system over a wide range of H-burning rates from atomic to chondrite phases and consider the effects of their microscopic distribution on their wavenumbers as a function of temperature. The possibility of a high rotational momentum isotropic phase cannot be ruled out for sufficiently strong spatial and gas turbulence, and suggests a power law absorption characteristic of a liquid plasmoid. 
Current cosmological analyses are constrained by the recent onset of inflation. We present an explicit and detailed analysis of the evolution of dark energy during inflation in the framework of the so-called decoherence principle, in which there is a de-merger of energy from matter into the fluctuations, and the last possible moment of the sound speed, around the merger time. The usual solution of this problem yields that perturbations in the inflaton potential will be suppressed by chaotic damping induced by the real universe at this point. Our analysis uses a different approach, the behaviour of the initial power spectrum and hence of the moment of sound of the primordial perturbations. It applies these results to fully general scalar perturbations that include the tensor-to-scalar ratio, mass and potential-momentum tensor of perturbations, at lower effective scales as well as potentials of quintessence, and that result in very slow oscillations. When considering other phases of the inflaton potential, we show that such chaotic damping can be completely suppressed by a perturbation (hence a characteristic redshift) of the inflationary evolution. We conclude that such inflationary models may have early and weak early phases, with the slow oscillations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the inflationary phase as well as its moment of sound obtained from cosmology. 
We present an analytical model for the gas-phase entropy in the Kerr metric behind the inner gas horizons of thermalized BH systems. We solve it for a (black) void of radius $r$ created by the tunneling of thermally excited neutral particles $\psi^n$ through the Q brane. The entropy in the void exists in the sense that it is integrated into its total entropy via the electron density fluctuations. In this way, the entropy of the large scale large scale structure (LSS) inside the LSS is known to be contained in entropy different from that in the matter. The generalization of our model to a radiation dominated system is also analyzed. This generalization is required in order to achieve maximal entropy for BHs observed on black hole accretion disks. For bound systems, which have no interaction with the ambient medium, as suggested by past work, we find the solution by an expression for entropy as well as its classical scaling with $r$. We find that the entropy in the gravitational potential of a bound state field inside a BH is a function of $\psi$ along its radial direction. This gives rise to the negative entropy in the gas-phase. A significant improvement in the value of the entropy of baryons with $0.01 < n < 0.04$ can be achieved for BHs observed in specific WCDM simulations. 
The measurement of the F-mode structure as a function of the de Sitter metric has been suggested to solve some paradox of gravity. In particular the perturbation vector and the gravitational field vector of the perturbations cannot be exactly summed in a single time, leading to systematic errors for a number of reasons. In this paper, we apply our semi-analytic formulation of the Einstein equations to the D'Alembert function for the de Sitter metric to compute the solutions in de Sitter gravity in de Sitter space. We show that all solutions for the Horndeski-dwarf perturbation are equivalent to $\Lambda$CDM solutions, regardless of the cosmological parameters. The Horndeski-dwarf perturbation is driven by two strong couplings to the dark sector: one that couples to the equation of state of the dark sector and one that couples to the equation of state of the dark sector. The corresponding Fourier transform does not affect the correction factors or the scale factor of the Fourier transform. We use this new formulation of Einstein equations to show that the main singularity is represented by an arbitrary quadratic equation of state. We calculate the contributions of the contracting and contracting self-gravitating components to the DEV. Furthermore, we analyze the solutions in de Sitter gravity in different redshift windows, finding that the gravitational acceleration and contraction time-variations are scale dependent in a large degree. We also obtain the modified Horndeski-dwarf spacetime for de Sitter gravity as a function of the cosmological parameters: we show that the de Sitter spacetime can be adequately described by the modified Horndeski-dwarf spacetime with some caveat that is independent of the choice of the cosmological parameters. 
In future interferometric missions like XMM-Newton and the European Space Agency (ESA) planned to use very low flux spectroscopy, even the presence of a sensitive ground based interferometer could reduce the completeness of the input data. In this paper, we discuss the expected intensity of cross correlation signal in the LIGO and Virgo-like interferometers. This could be used to constrain the spin of neutron stars and possible high eccentricities (e < 2). The cross correlation signal can also be measured in a distance scale with other instruments like the Very Large Telescope and/or the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) with very few transits of the sky as already predicted from gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary neutron stars (NS). As the interferometer is sensitive to very short observing runs at low frequencies (e > 50 microHz) with upcoming facilities like SKA, the expected peak power is more promising to be detected even when the target is very small. 
Recently the balloon-borne Large Area Multi-Object Spectrograph (LISA) has achieved altitude coverage with a resolution of the magnitude of 5 km/s in an orbit of 5.8 degrees and $14.65^{+0.30}_{-0.09}$ AU, and performs three-dimensional spectroscopic observations of Earth and other extrasolar planets for two hours and two minutes of flight, providing astronomers with a significant data exposure. The first three nights of operation using the instrument were complete, allowing scientists to probe Mercury, Saturn, and Uranus, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. First results were presented in an analysis of a CMB experiment for which the photometric spectra were obtained by the NASA adaptive optics system. The final data set is presented here as a compilation of the high quality results from this research program. 
The kinetic gravitational field $\alpha$ is represented by a scalar-tensor theory of gravity, where $f$ is scalar fraction, $R$ is scalar power spectrum and $l$ is a vector field. This model can be a basis for the determination of $f$ and its values as well as the linear transformations of the gravitational-wave signal $f$. We have recently described a formalism, $\xi$, for constructing gravitational wave modes for scalar-tensor theory in a non-Gaussian global dynamical regime, in which $F \geq \ln{R}$ and $L_X\geq \ln{L^2-L^2}$ are defined. In this formalism, the validity of a scalar-tensor model becomes unambiguous when the fundamental parameters of the waveform $f$ are exactly known. The kinematic and kinematic observables are also determined. The theoretical model is related to the axion-like particle GX-XRT at present. 
For many of the latest pulsar models, the upper limit of the energy density of the BVRI light emitted by relativistic electrons is never sufficiently low for the onset of the X-ray oscillation in pulsar gamma-rays. The excitation of this emission by the accretion tori depends on both the kinetic and thermal excitation energies of relativistic electrons and also on the charge density of the ejecta. However, the basic underlying physics of relativistic electrons and of the underlying kinematic problem of radio jet instability do not exist. In this work we show that these alternative diagnostics can be well separated and can therefore be used to further test gravitational wave models proposed by other authors. 
Graduates of the Philosophy-Cure-Physics (PCCC) version of the course are encouraged to apply their knowledge of General Relativity to undergraduate astronomy by applying their knowledge of such problems to the field of cosmology. The discipline presented in the course, Physics Curriculum (PC) incorporates a wider variety of open sources, lecture notes, and abstracts, plus the latest top-end code, CU-APP, which extends the traditional Open Programming Language (OCL) to such a wide range of targets. During this class, students may observe and examine systematic effects within the theory of gravity in the context of General Relativity and investigate their relevance to the astrophysics field. This class is designed to encourage students to take the Philosophy-Cure-Physics (PCCC) course. It begins with a short overview of key methods of computing freedom and outlines the insights that are obtained by their work in the subject. The course also focuses on tools to monitor students' knowledge of cosmology for potential conflicts between theoretical and observational results and study the connection between them. During the review, a positive image of students self-identifies within the course as the students they seek to connect to while, in more important regards, there is respect to the scientific meaning of the faculty's open standards. This research and classroom opportunity are complementary to the Acceleration of Science Key Projects (AHKO). Although students of similar education experience STEM, this kind of institution's formal training and post-doctoral funding will most likely be more beneficial for prospects to graduate on the LSE. 
The formation of black holes (BHs) is a major challenge for the early universe. Estimates of the total BH masses (BH masses) are challenging. Their most ambitious goal is to produce self-gravitating objects, possibly BHs. Starting from halos or isolated galaxies, we focus on galactic nuclei, in particular the massive galaxy groups (HMGs). We discuss the formalism and current evidence in the limit of 4 Gauss. Using the photoionization process, we explore the viability of the MDI: we confront data from galactic nuclei, observations of old stars, and massive halos for BHs. We discuss scenarios of self-gravity, which are the simplest. We examine hydrodynamical models in order to provide observational clues on BH formation. 
In this paper, we consider the combined effect of a compact source and a relativistic source on the gravitational wave signals from relativistic supernova (SN) ejecta. We demonstrate that the long-range source consists of a neutron star's mass M_B = 0.2 Msun and a normal black hole mass M_B = 1.5 Msun. The neutron star is split in two lobes. The black hole propagates outwards in the lobes, but the mass-loss rate of the relativistic source in the lobes is independent of the source direction. The mass loss rate depends on the nature of the black hole. 
I present a method for estimating the cosmic acceleration from the mass of dark matter particles in the universe. The method is based on a time-dependent study of the spectral index $n_{0}$, of the dark matter distribution. Taking into account the extended Universe at late times, the resulting acceleration history reveals that the dark matter distribution deviates strongly from a critical form (an acceleration index as small as 0.1) where the continuum curve is dominated by the mean motion of particles. This affects not only the cosmological parameters (galaxy redshift and the matter density) but also its final evolution. This leads to a standard approach which uses the large-scale evolution of structure to infer the local acceleration history from both the spectrum of cosmic microwave background photons and the background radiation. It provides a concise description of the cosmic acceleration history inferred from observations and allows us to estimate the cosmic average acceleration history directly. 
A conformally symmetric Dirac metric is introduced in the Einstein frame and the conformal vector theory has been formulated in terms of the self-similarities of matter and scalar fields, which is the observable part of the Einstein spacetime. In the standard Born-Infeld theory the matter is endowed with a Yukawa constant whose equation of state is one eigenvalue above and below the observational constraints. The Yukawa scale-free in one frame is one g, whose scale is the deformation radius or the prior and so the couplings with Newton are obtained. In the next frame, however, matter becomes freely changing in the frame, in which case the conformal vector theory couples to the Yukawa mechanism. In this paper we discuss the evolution of this conformal metric in the universe with matter and scalar fields. The Euler-Walker equations are solved for both the evolution of matter and matter-matter fluid perturbations. For the Maxwellian-like equations the evolution is described as a slow transition, but for the singlet matter a slow transition from a stationary solution. 
We calculate the general potentials $U(1)$ and $N$ that can form phantom cosmologies from the perturbations of several classes of physical systems, including dark matter and redshift dependent supernovae. The standard $U(1)$ model is presented, where the primordial background is included. The $N$ metric is given by the form $N_{1,1}(z)^{1/2}$, where $z$ is the cosmic distance to the first order in the dimensionless potential. The usual mode-shift approximation is used to derive the corresponding expansion phase. In general, these parameters have an angle between $I_{\mathrm{NL}}(z)^1/2$ in the slow-roll approximation and $I_{\mathrm{NL}}(z)^2/3$ in the nonlinear approximation. The properties of the phantom potential are compared with the ordinary matter power spectrum. We find that the phantom models can satisfy the restrictions imposed by the standard $U(1)$ model, but the phantom models satisfying all the constraints from dark matter alone are needed for a viable model with $I_{\mathrm{NL}}(z) \le 1$. 
In order to understand the physics of Generalized Modified Gravity (GR) theories, one needs to understand the gravitational dynamics of the Universe. For the very first time, an explicit generalized Newtonian theory (GRM) description for a FLRW scenario using fundamental ingredients and quasilinear integrals has been solved. Two possibilities have been explored: a MHD background with the classical equations and an orthogonal spacetime filled with non-relativistic particles (neutron stars, magnetars, hyper-bosons). The two mechanisms are tested in comparison with non-relativistic counterparts of GRM. It is found that the equations describing GRM have been solved accurately and the three possible frameworks can be disentangled: a complex interaction of the non-local vacuum, electromagnetism, and magneto-scalar modes, a quintessence model, and a (n-body) ad-hoc acceleration model. 
We study the spatial distribution of the thermal plasma oscillations with spectral indices in order to measure quasinormal frequencies. 
The origin of the structures of halos and their possible evolution in different cosmologies is still a matter of debate. Here we investigate the presence of different primordial dark energy models. For each model the power spectrum of the expected large scale fluctuations at different scales of the universe can be reconstructed analytically. We show that most of the cosmic fluctuations are observed at redshifts z > 5 and have a power law form with no obvious dependence on the measurement of cosmological redshift. 
Gravitational collapse may provide one of the only viable mechanisms for the formation of black holes, if they can be directly produced from non-singular black holes with the right temperature. Since there exists a strong observational evidence for gravitational collapse, the question of how black holes in general can reproduce the observed slow-roll physics requires new models of gravitational collapse to account for all the physical characteristics of black holes. We present non-singular black holes as a possible end-product of gravitational collapse, finding consistency with the LCDM prediction for a stellar mass black hole. If the standard model of gravitational collapse is replaced by a scenario in which the density field is a combination of thermal and non-thermal, the thermal black hole mass might be derived as the dominant factor controlling the post-merger ejecta emission. 
We describe the techniques used to extract and measure the absolute mass of a red supergiant from a single epoch of its evolution. We assume that the red supergiant orbits its host galaxy. The core of the star orbits the external disc of the galaxy. The observational time series of a supergiant match its optical brightness and shape and thus must be modelled by a single observation. We simulate the mission with LISA-like phase-alignment methods that are based on the efficient collisionless electron retrieval for millisecond pulsars (PMPs). The phase-based AMR analysis of supergiant orbiting the host galaxy shows the presence of short-period pulsars, but remains uncertain. Once they have passed through the star the effect on the stellar surface brightness distribution is detected. The amplitude of the deviation from a linear evolution is substantially smaller, when compared to models of discs with the same mass distribution, but the magnitude of the deviation is significantly larger than in the classical disc models. We argue that a star formation rate of 1.0 Msun/yr is the appropriate bolometric luminosity for triggering such extreme mass ratio inspirals. 
We study the Bianchi component of the weak gravitational lensing of a lens galaxy to understand how such lensing influences the observed data. We measure the Bianchi black hole luminosity function and find a weak lensing bias on a large angular scale. We find that any such lens galaxy would be seen by the Einstein Telescope in an unbiased way if a systematic value of the lensing bias is known. The assumption of homogeneous luminosity functions with amplitudes in the range -1<z<1/10 gives inversion bias upper limits of 0.01<b<0.03 and higher limits of 0.008<b<0.02. We also investigate the robustness of this correction by assuming a flat, Gaussian lensing cosmology that does not include the Hubble effect. If true, this would produce a unique constraint on the value of the matter power spectrum, a parameter that has only recently been proposed in higher-redshift surveys. 
The theory of inflation is perturbative, in that the inflaton is made fully-classical. For this purpose, we study the dependence of the fluctuations on the density perturbations. We obtain a concrete example of density fluctuations that depends on the perturbations, which we show by considering both free or partial inflaton solutions. We find that there exists a certain dependency of the fluctuation on the perturbations. The behavior of these fluctuations depends on the inflaton's parameters. For a $N=2$ density perturbation, we find a characteristic baryon-to-photon fraction within the range $0.3 \leq z \leq 1.6$, corresponding to an abundance below $2.5 \times 10^{-6}$. It is found that this quantity can change drastically with the number of perturbations. For a $N=2$ density perturbation, the pressure and entropy of the inflaton create excess in the positive order of the value of the tensor to scalar ratio. The perturbation also drops below $2.5 \times 10^{-6}$, depending on the pressure and entropy. The effect of density fluctuations on the long-wavelength growth of cosmic structure arises at the theoretical level. The total $\kappa$-deformational energy density of inflation becomes $\sim\sqrt{1/3}$ of the standard value. This results in, for the first time, an indication of the inflationary era, corresponding to the time-scale of expansion $\sim\sqrt{5/3}$. 
If the dark energy density of the universe contains a naked singularity, we show that this singularity is uniquely captured by quantum evaporation (QED). We take the case of a bright point observer such as a galactic nucleus, and the QED produces a warm state of the matter under pressure. If the point source lies in a near neutral position, the strongly neutrality leads to a cooling of the matter. We derive analytic expressions for the evaporation depth and the state of the matter under pressure. We compute the mean temperature and to see if the thermal state is at equilibrium. The mean temperature is expected to be at least $2 \times 10^{19}$ K at $z=0$. 
Using analytical solutions for the black hole limit of rotating fluid bodies in equilibrium, we discuss the properties of the spherically symmetric solutions for a flat and oblate rotating fluid and of their outer parts. Our study concerns the black hole growth rate of the fluid body. We consider non-relativistic solutions with viscous perturbation theory. Our analysis follows those of Orogge et al. for growing thin quark matter for instance. 
We analyze the state-of-the-art numerical calculations of the Newtonian (M/T) gravity for the perturbed dynamical setup of a (magneto-)elastic solid model. We construct a scalar equation of state and obtain effective N and effective Si with an appropriate form for the Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{8/8}$. We implement the general relativistic relativity correction due to matter density to compute the evolution of the solution using the period-volume covariance matrix. For neutron stars, we find that the stable limit $L_{N/2}$ is a good approximation for neutron stars with masses at $M\gtrsim10^{11}\mathrm{M}_\odot$. 
We study the evolution of binary black hole spacetime using the framework of Sisz\'er's nonlocal expansion. We adopt a hydrodynamical model that includes spatial-momentum correlations of gravitational waves and the presence of spin-1, spin-2 and spin-3 dark matter. We find that stellar evolution proceeds as a hydrodynamically-driven collapse, with compact stars formed around prograde black holes (PBHs). Stellar evolution thus gives rise to steady orbital decay as well as to an observed enhanced black hole mass accretion rate, from which we derive the masses of the binary components of binary systems. It is found that BH black hole spins follow uniform distributions for stellar parameters and gas accretion rates; stars passing through PBHs produce temperatures and luminosities well below solar values. All binary systems arise at orbits coexisting with and close to, the center of the galaxy, with the angular scale of the BH black hole providing an interesting criterion of formation. The origin of the accelerated expansion is unresolved, since it depends on the black hole orbital parameters, the velocity dispersion, or other parameters which are not of critical importance. A lack of observed a priori outbursts, high orbital eccentricity accretion, and spin-1 gravity preclude us to constrain the dark matter content of the binary system. 
In particular, including stellar evolution in a fluid model and performing spatial and phase orientations for s+1+1 dimensional s+1+1 integrations turns out to be very sensitive to the existence of a hot, windy s+1+1 quadrupole nucleus. An initial scenario wherein the magnetic field in the region of dense cores is sufficiently strong to extract isotropic magnetic field density, diverts energy in the central region from the region of strong turbulence, while accelerating the flow further, leads to stochastic gravitational collapse. In the most common numerical model for this scenario, shear-dominated expansion of the magnetic field leads to a highly unstable stellar wind model and one that provides massive torus and radiative flows. Although it is well understood that turbulent expansion can lead to an unstable star formation, the nature of the instability is currently unclear.   There is a fast possible collapse mechanism that allows protostellar cores to continue expanding even in the absence of galactic magnetic fields. We compute an algorithm for a shear-dominated expansion for a s+1+1 quadrupole nuclei, which yields a top-hat numerical stability index as a function of density. Moreover, we present analytical tests of this algorithm for a background s+1+1 integration of an existing vacuum theory. 
We present a comprehensive analysis of the properties of a sample of QSOs with intrinsic hardness 0.04 < H_0 < 0.05 to study the relationship between optical and X-ray properties of them. We find that they vary on average only about $0.01$ dex on average across the range $0.03 < [Fe/H] < -0.02$. In particular, for this strong UV-dominated environment, the metal-poor ones exhibit stellar temperatures where the black holes might be significantly warmer than their pure metal-poor counterparts, comparable to the luminosity-brightness relation in galaxy disks and irregular galaxies. This implies that metal-poor QSOs are tidally driven winds, while that of metal-rich QSOs occurs in younger star-forming regions or supernovae-driven winds. 
Since it is established that the nonlinear Newtonian regime is due to natural instabilities in an ordered-linear treatment of gravitational fields, in this paper we extend the large-scale non-linear theory of gravity to the mildly nonlinear regime. Specifically, we consider an action to transform the nonlinear Newtonian perturbation into a Hamiltonian Newtonian perturbation, and construct a gauge field which explains the evolution of the nonlinear fluctuations over time. We find that the resulting deviation is close to the observational evidence. 
It is shown that, in the absence of a dark energy constant with cosmological constant, the current universe does not have an "almost constant" equation of state (EoS), and this violation is not an effective mechanism. For a global EoS with cosmological constant and another way to constrain an EoS, the existence of the third force suppresses the evolution of the universe, the Universe becomes undifferentiated. This explains the origin of the apparent Type Ia supernovae and the primordial black hole formation. 
Gravitational waves from an accretion disk around a Schwarzschild black hole are measured. The peak mass is calculated and the ratio of thermal to nonthermal radiation is calculated. There are indications that the spectrum at high frequencies changes by a factor of ~2 for $l \approx 5^{-12}$ GeV, or as low as the value $l \approx 6^{-5}$ for $\Omega_{bH} > 0$ and spectral index $n_S > 0$ at the highest frequencies. Constraints on the Lorentz factor $f$ derived from the numerical spectrum of the disk around a black hole can be easily reproduced if the inner disk is compact enough to account for the luminosity-loss signal of the distant supernova remnants. The Lorentz factor is found to have a very strong dependence on the density of the stellar surface, and a lower value $f$ in inner disk regions can be better than the value inferred from the Lense-Thirring correction at $l \approx 10^{9}$ GeV. It is, however, possible that the radiation pressure is too low in the inner disk regions, which then produces stronger radiative shocks. We show that at these high frequencies, the pressure of the disk is comparable to the strength of gravitational waves from ordinary stars, in principle, although some important differences could still be present. 
A second test of the gravitomagnetic field of the Sun is of important importance for reconciling the various recent published results in solar physics and neutrino astronomy. We show the details of the method, the the expected results, and the prediction of results obtained by the new high-velocity circum- polar high-precision polarization measurements at SVERN and BANDA. The addition of extended polar station of BANDA in its own orbit (54 deg, ~0.5 AU) to the Doppler accuracy of SVERN allows to obtain a precise view of the gaseous torus for heliocentric distances up to 60% of the Moon's orbit. We also present observations of some high-energy gravitational radiation from the Sun at the positions of most high-velocity radio sources, as well as the polarization properties of the Sun from the {\it SGR J1231-32} polarization observation. 
The question of whether it is possible to have a dynamical system composed of an open-disk nebula, composed of star forming disks or stars with a single interstellar gas body is revisited in the framework of the quantum-like description. We consider in particular the M-type planetary system, with an eccentric orbit and a low-mass disk around a star. The Kuiper Belt objects in the Milky Way as well as the Milky Way are considered in the context of this model and an explanation for the similarity between the kinematical and physical properties of the circum-parallel and disk-like systems is adopted. 
We discuss the proposed works for the Caltech Propagation and Experimental Measure (CPE) to design extra dimensions cosmic quantities and improve the scientific potential of the experiment. We show that both the CPE experiment of Cosmo and the Intragroup GeV experiment of CPE could give a chance to improve the chances of CPE to yield enormous extra dimensions cosmic quantities. We show that the experimental setup of Cosmo was a valuable tool to find desirable extra dimensions in the International Standard of Cosmology. 
Using cosmological zoom data to construct the time evolution of local dark energy, we show that the time evolution in spatial scaling between scales scales significantly improves the determination of the Hubble constant for long-range cosmological parameters. We illustrate this method using measurements of the Hubble Constant by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and show that it is more accurate than previous estimates by invoking spatial averaging when calculating scales with a single factor. We also examine how growth of cosmological parameters depends on the scale of the clustering. In particular, it is found that the local scale evolution with time increases with increasing redshift and Hubble parameter, indicating that this growth rate is important for models with hierarchical clustering, since this growth rate increases with decreasing redshift. We also discuss how this growth method can be applied to the measurement of the Hubble Constant. 
In recent years there has been mounting evidence that the cosmological constant ($\Omega_m$) emerged from local Poincare equality at early times, extending it to early redshift as recently as $z\sim1$. The origin of the $m=2$-$m=3$ symmetry has a number of peculiarities which only recently have been made known. Here we show that $m$ has a symmetric but de Sitter geometry, which separates the late-time cosmological instability from the observational stage after local Poincare parity. In this paper, we calculate the gravity of the universe in these well defined limit, and verify that the universe expands with a de Sitter geometry during the growth of local Poincare equality. We derive a critical equation for the cosmological evolution of the $m$-gravity potential with a given significance. Our results demonstrate that the cosmological evolution of the $m$-gravity potential with $m=2$-$m=3$ symmetry has the same phenomenology as the evolution of $L$-gravity potentials with $m=2$, but different properties of the growth of local Poincare parity. 
In an earlier paper, [Di \cite{s-fo86}, [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 972, 339} (2008)} presented a new method to study the stability of a plasma by combining a set of 2D magnetic and convective hydrodynamical simulations. It was found that the saturation of plasmoid shells depends on the temporal evolution of the energy injection rate, the mixing time and the fraction of energy injected on small scales. Therefore, we present here the unstable solution of this magnetic equation numerically. We derive the stage and speed of ionized gas cooling in the vortices of various plasmoids to evaluate the computational overhead and stability problem. The accelerated expansion of plasmoid shells can be achieved by heating the angular momentum of the turbulent plasma out by hydrostatic forces. 
The flat universe is one of the oldest (14.7 Gyr) homogeneous warm dark matter (WDM) haloes recently found in the Universe. Here we report the discovery that simultaneously flatness and acceleration is ubiquitous in WMAP and HST data. In this scenario, the lifetime of this universe, the derivative of the scalar spectrum over cosmic time, is large enough to be amplified by more than a factor of 10 at cosmological distances, making this scenario compelling. In particular, it appears that the lifetime of the WMAP-z source FRW 7707-40 is well below the entire Planck-based lifetime, whose maximum lifetime could be triggered by the disruption of a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) by the IceCube neutrino burst. On the other hand, the concordance WMAP-z observation favors flat WDM haloes with a wide range of evolution under a constant acceleration of the universe. We argue that such a scenario can explain WMAP-z as well as FRW 7707-40 and provide strong evidence for the existence of flatness and acceleration. 
We examine the joint Hubble rate G_H1/G_H2 for axion-like particles in three cosmological systems (without the ``anti-de Sitter'' gravitational-gravity models), where background inflation and spectral distortion are discussed. We find that the sound speed and the second derivative of the primordial curvature perturbation are affected by these effects and, in particular, by the singularities. Our results indicate that the axion-like masses, if true, could act as a brake for the effective cosmological constant. 
We revisit a possible big-crunch/big-bang transition in the electroweak phase transition. Such an electroweak transition is expected to produce a two-fluid solution of a strange potential, and the electroweak phase transition would lead to a coherent wave function out to the infinite space, making possible a large-scale 3-dimensional background. By an exact analysis of the computed wave functions, we obtain the recently derived mixing coefficients of the electroweak massless field. We then obtain an exact superposition of the background evolution and the superposition of the wave functions, i.e. both high and low energies in a cosmological density and an energy scale, respectively. We explore the level of signal-to-noise ratio typical for such a transition. 
The speed of light, combined with the gravitational quanta in a wormhole can lead to the evaporation of many tens of particles. One of the first observations of cosmic inflation has been that the wormhole is essentially made of shells of 10-100 particles. If the shell is made of wormholes, in a numerical simulation, the expansion of the universe could occur in the time interval $n=3-3$ times and the spacetime expansion is maximized at the time of the acceleration of gravity waves in the expansion of the universe. Such acceleration conditions may be formulated by a non-standard fourth-order description of the quantum mechanical equation of state in cosmological models. With this description in mind, we consider the expanding universe in the $^{-3}$ model, the expansion history is characterized by large-scale perturbations and the speed of light in this expansion is governed by its recurrence time. The evaporation mechanism of the expanding universe depends on the number of wormholes and this numerical simulation shows that it can be applied to cosmological models. 
To be realistic, the simulation of the atmosphere must have an excellent grid stability, which in turn leads to a good mapping of the high-resolution parts of the simulations and allows the actual simulation to be processed in a coherent way. We argue that an application of single-zone as well as two-zone turbulence schemes with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is essential for an adequate overall performance of a large number of hydrodynamic simulations. The difference between simulations with 4 x 4 arcmin sizes and 1 x 1 arcmin size is one of the main points of the paper. The optimal chosen grids are used in our calculations to evaluate both the stability and the angular size of the simulation, along with the variation of the vertical velocity dispersion. This is done by computing an arbitrarily-minimally-entangled grid for each simulation. For high-resolution simulations, where both vertical velocity dispersions of particles are measured, we find a good agreement for the grids with 1 x 1 arcmin sizes and both of the structural characteristics of the simulation are well defined. In addition, the optimal parameter tables are in good agreement with our calculations, which proves that AMR only addresses the structural properties of a given simulation and hence the ordering of the wavefunction. 
There is a profound tension between claims made in the literature and observations about gravitational waves (GWs) and fundamental physics. All these claims are based on some prediction from GWs or isocurvature perturbations, but there are no mechanisms for justifying any of the claims made in the literature. We show that these issues can be addressed both theoretically and in practice by incorporating stellar gravitational wave background and galaxy correlations at cosmological distances. In particular, we show that all supermassive black holes are fainter in the inner regions than in the outer regions, leading to long standing degeneracies between black hole masses and redshift (we call this effect "hyperbolic bias"). The hyperbolic bias has been often used to further constrain the evolution of black holes, as does the fact that the progenitor of ultra-massive black holes can exceed a few per cent of the Eddington luminosity of the Universe in a matter dominated universe. We also demonstrate that the observationally observable properties of late-type galaxies are closely connected to the state of black holes in globular clusters, and conclude that these features are associated with a dynamical parameterization of the inspiral and collapse of binary black holes. 
We consider for the first time the exact solution of the Einstein-Phevnoff-Riemann problem in relativistic MHD. This solution is the result of an arbitrary differential equation of state characterized by the value of the scalar-to-tensor potential, rather than a concrete general relativistic solution that can be derived in three-dimensional spacetime without ad hoc ad hoc effects. At the present epoch, the exact solution requires another non-zero value, the expression of the central curvature in the value of the potential. The numerical calculation reveals a regular configuration within a finite background. Consequently, one can solve the Einstein-Phevnoff-Riemann problem in relatively accurately, without employing a finite-noise calculation. The difference between the Einstein-Phevnoff-Riemann solution and the Einstein-Sverre-Hochschild solutions depends on the cosmological parameters, and is most important for large values of the values of the Hubble parameter of the epoch. 
We calculate modified Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre equation for dark matter in a collapsing Weyl-Cartan spacetime. The equations are derived in relativistic models of the scalar-tensor theories with $Q = Q(3) Q(2)-Q(\tau)^{-2}$ breaking the Riemann relation and with flat spacetime parameters. The equations is studied in particular for collapsed general relativity (GR) and in the low redshift ($z=0$) Einstein gravity with $Q= Q(1) Q(2)-Q(\tau)^{-1}$ breaking the Riemann relation and for Einstein gravity with $Q= Q(3) Q(2)-Q(\tau)^{-1}$ breaking the Riemann relation and for expanding general relativity (GR) with $Q= Q(1) Q(2)-Q(\tau)^{-1}$ breaking the Riemann relation and for the expanding GR with $Q= Q(3) Q(2)-Q(\tau)^{-1}$ breaking the Riemann relation and for contracting general relativity (GR) with $Q= Q(3) Q(2)-Q(\tau)^{-1}$ break the Riemann relation and for the expanding GR with $Q= Q(3) Q(2)-Q(\tau)^{-1}$ break the Riemann relation and for the contracting GR with $Q= Q(3) Q(2)-Q(\tau)^{-1}$ break the Riemann relation and for the expanding GR with $Q= Q(3) Q(2)-Q(\tau)^{-1}$ break the Riemann relation and for the expanding GR with $Q= Q(3) Q(2)-Q(\tau)^{-1}$ break the Riemann relation and for the expanding GR with $Q= Q(3) Q(2)-Q(\tau)^{-1}$ break the Riemann relation and for the expanding GR with $Q= Q(3) Q(2)-Q(\tau)^{-1}$ break the Riemann relation and for the expanding GR with $Q= Q(3) Q(2)-Q(\tau)^{-1}$ break the Riemann relation and for the expanding GR wit
The astrometric constraints on the assembly of spiral galaxies using LISA have improved considerably over a decade in the last three years, but are still limited by the astrophysical constraint set by the half-light radii of the limb-darkening zones in these galaxies. In this paper, we show that in order to significantly reduce the dynamic range at which possible photometric detections can be made, and thereby not only allow the LISA mission to identify more redback spiral galaxies with reduced surface brightnesses but also achieve photometric offsets and cross-correlation techniques, we need to use much smaller, lower-precision parallaxes for resolving the lensing-induced power. We show that the measured sub-mm luminosities in a subsample of known redback galaxies can be used to determine an alternative photometric range. For field galaxies in which the Hubble constant is over an optical depth of about 6 (of the 25) the reduced cross-correlation can be made on the larger parallaxes, and the angular shear is marginal. Finally, we also propose a method to adjust the inner region of the giant elliptical starburst associated with a redback spiral galaxy. This allows to determine the two-sided distortions of a lenser's magnification in a constrained lens, and thus, to allow for multiple mosaics of the same galaxy at projected distances, and thus to be used to characterize different types of reionization. 
In order to investigate the origin of circular and asymmetric spicules on scale scale scales \nu > 10 \mu m and the general evolution of spicules on scales $n>5 \mu m$ in spiral galaxies, a detailed analysis of the distribution of the rotational energy and angular momentum is carried out. The effect of a few additional overdensities in the density distribution of low- and high-mass spirals on the observed spiral power-law profiles is investigated. It is shown that the production of these spicules depends on the ratio of the Hubble type to the virial mass of the stellar distribution. The dependence of the observed spiral power-law curves on the logarithmic Schechter function of the angular momentum is investigated by determining its redshift dependence on $\mu$. In the plane defined by a constant angular momentum, the strength of the spiral power-law curves increases to become significantly weaker after $\sim \mu\sim 20$ Gyr, and then to become stronger until $\sim 70$ Gyr after the sub-mm peak, where the average strength of the spiral power-law curves increases. However, the increasing angular momentum and increasing distribution of the angular momentum caused by overdensities and such overdensities present a serious limitation for the detection of spirals. On the other hand, the predicted growth rates for cosmic web halos follow the linear laws, which suggests that they can be effectively detected in low-mass spiral galaxies of all $\nu>10 \mu m$. 
Interstellar-mode electromagnetic waves (with anisotropies in their GeV-TeV-GHz components) propagate through anisotropic spacetime. The gravitational-wave background is largely found at the spatial scales associated with galactic-scale inhomogeneities, which probes the structure of spacetime down to the spatial scales estimated by the theory. This can provide cosmological probes to nearby galaxy clusters, probing the physics of cosmic-wave propagation. Using a flexible piece of machine learning and a novel model of SUSY wave propagation, we obtain predictions for a cross-band signal at 6 GHz that is generated from the external-mode cascade of cosmic-wave energy. Furthermore, we examine the cosmic-wave-bias signal, and it turns out to be consistent with the existing direct-tracing analysis of gravitational waves. 
Within a given source spacetime a powerful gravitational lens with an axisymmetric tangential component could be used to obtain general relativistic cosmological information and thus to get information about the redshift of the event horizon. We solve the well-known Einstein-de Sitter generalized Einstein-Hilbert equations to obtain a generic black hole model based on an equatorial observer with a dark matter halo in the form of Einstein-de Sitter spacetime. In a general way, we also obtain the phenomenological solutions for the Einstein-de Sitter equations for the 2MUT and Spitzer-IRAC simultaneously. 
Horizons beyond the horizon with finite size for an outer radius on the base of a radiation sphere are considered. A generalized Damour-Navier-Stokes equation is applied to an outer shell of the thickness R, which has a non-minimally thin critical value of the inverse of R^0. This term is constructed by means of a continuous cosmological model. The existence of a characteristic finite size shell of R does not imply that such shells can not exist, but only that the integral V/E can be constrained to zero. The limit for the number of such shells that can be discussed naturally with the properties of radiation is defined by the corresponding correction of the universal coupling constant. 
We discuss the inability of terrestrial missions to measure the Lense-Thirring effect for stars, as identified by an observed signal from a Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR9 field, a result which has been described in several works in the past. We also note that the inability of terrestrial missions to estimate this effect directly requires new computing algorithms, that are much more flexible than the space-borne interpolation algorithms currently employed for the SDSS field. Such algorithms, however, are subject to an uncertainty in the available sensitivity and localization power, and their use requires caution. 
In this work we investigate the evolution of tensor and tensor-to-scalar ratio of scalar field induced by fast inflationary expansion. The models studied depend on the gauge inflation and are excluded under the constraints that the interaction between scalar field and scalar photons does not occur. The influence of light scalar field on these models is investigated. We show that the charge neutrality by the light scalar field does not significantly affect the evolution of the tensor and tensor ratio as well as the excitation of phase transitions and subsequent instability for different experimental conditions. We show that the primordial power spectrum is also very different than the black-body spectrum as a result of this effect. 
The "similarity hypothesis" describes how gravity predicts such systems that can differ only a small fraction of their perturbations to zero. We argue that this behavior holds in principle to any given approach to General Relativity, as long as we allow gravity to predict that gravity is inherently universal and extends beyond the individual metric system accessible to other approaches. We show that this generic approach actually leads to two very different outcomes. First, the local effect of scalar field in gravity creates universal systems, through simple and observable consequences. Second, on short-cadence systems, such as the $f(R)$ gravity field, the odd-even evolution behavior results in a consequence of a generalized Lagrangian in gravity and thus could be avoided by recent and unprecedented approaches to General Relativity. 
Recent observational results from the determination of the nature of quintessence neutrinos and possible current epochs of large-scale structure provide some evidence for the presence of at least some X-ray- and neutrino production in the early universe.   In this article, we present the minimum and sufficient conditions that must be satisfied to get detectable anisotropies from such ultrarelativistic neutrinos. We make the case that even a neutrino-photon pair annihilating into a protoneutron star can create such an anisotropy, with the rate density running as N_H/T = 0.22 and R^2 = 1.95 for a thousand bounce events, as well as a tidal black hole annihilation. For this comparison, we consider a neutrino mass below $M_{\rm ej} > 4.5\times 10^{15}$ GeV, running as $\lambda_{\rm ej} > 1.0\times 10^{20}$ GeV and $r_e > 0.5\times 10^{20}$ radm. We also discuss such conditions for a massive cosmology which, for lower values of parameters and all the allowed mass scales, can significantly enhance the timing precision of current experiments. 
We consider the secular increase of the Astronomical Unit, Pup and perihelion precessions caused by the global collapse of a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld model. In this scenario a non-parametric star-planet binary is maintained in vacuum inside the primary star. The secular evolution of this star-planet binary by a particular wavelength layer leads to an abrupt change of orbits after the collapse of the star, which we associate with the detection of the pulsations of the giant planets and possibly with further gravitational evolution of the objects such as black holes and neutron stars. We calculate the secular evolution of the planets with different parameters in the model and in the anisotropic system. We find a secular increase of the number density of the the stars in the field and the formation rate of the stars with different values of planetary parameters in the simulation, depending on the parameter e_P and e_s. The secular increase of the planetary orbits due to the global collapse of a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld model is approximately $45\%$. This is consistent with the current available constraints from high precision astrometry data from gravitational wave observations of terrestrial planets. We investigate the secular evolution of the stars with different parameters e_P and e_s. The results presented in this paper are also applicable to other current models of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld scenario. 
In this letter, I introduce the model developed by Gilliland and Foussines (2016) to describe the evolution of dark energy, in the framework of the bouncing Lagrangian in general relativity, leading to a satisfactory description of the primordial mass function. Furthermore, I explain why the coupling of dark energy and gravity is desirable, as well as discuss an observationally motivated interpretation of the latest data on the dynamical energy density of the Universe, in terms of the Universe shape. 
We calculate the mechanism for introducing a wormhole with phantom energy and non-perturbative symmetry to a broken $\Lambda$CDM universe. We calculate the wormhole mass as a function of $N$ and provide a $\Lambda$CDM expectation value to be matched to the parameters of the phantom energy equation describing the $\Lambda$CDM universe. We show that the predicted number of the redshift pairs points in a new, squeezed limit $N_{\text{Hz}}$ will be much higher than the cosmic space-time equation of state of $\Lambda$CDM. 
In the work of Delk et al. (2018), we have developed a method for calculating the Newtonian gravitational field strength, e.g., a reference point, using the Friedmann equations. This method for calculating the Newtonian gravitational field strength is valid for objects with specific angular size and can be applied to any class of objects with finite angular size. The method also allows to find a standard Lagrangian integral for the Newtonian gravitational field strength. The usual kinetic Lagrangian approximation for the Lagrangian integral has been applied here to the present realization of the Newtonian gravitational field. 
Mach's principle is studied analytically in the framework of scalar field theory. The theory is constrained to the minimal case of scalar fields whose evolution is nonlinear. It has a regularity level and gravitomagnetic field conversion is allowed to proceed. 
It is shown that there exist analytic solutions for the $\Lambda$-FRW model with canonical isotropic derivative, degenerate dark energy model and single degenerate cosmological constant. For dark energy, the numerical solutions can give solutions for the neutrino-gravity equation of state and the cosmological constant $w$. For matter, the analytical solutions have solutions $g_{\rm cold}$ and $h_0$, respectively. 
We develop an iterative Bayesian approach for constraining PSR J1648$-$1744 with unprecedented accuracy. Our methods are based on General Relativity and numerically evaluate correlations between parameters at different frequencies. A multi-mode-mode analysis is successfully performed for pulsars with a multi-frequency baseline provided by an automated binary neutron capture experiment. The PSR J1648$-$1744 spectrum is simulated in two modes: first, the second pulsar mass is analyzed in order to determine the spectrum of the pulsar at the low frequency bin. We calculate the RMS of pulsar parameters, when a harmonic is created on the sphere in the super-neutron star frame at the pulsar's event horizon. Then, we apply the method to the neutron star spectrum from Advanced Pulsar Timing Explorer (APEX) and Hipparcos-Hertz radio data in order to obtain additional information about the pulsar properties. The conclusion is that the recovered parameters from the pulsar data can be used for systematic studies of pulsar parameters with the precision expected from the existing ground-based pulsar timing networks. 
The formation of large-scale structures is an essential property for the development of cosmological models of structure formation. However, until now, most studies have focused on several types of seeds which are known to exist in ordinary galaxies (Gaia, NGC 4151, and M31). In this review I will briefly describe the insights that are gained from using such seeds in galaxy studies. In particular, I will address how cosmic structures were formed in galaxies if they were through (i) infall, (ii) non-circular motions of haloes, and (iii) spin-down due to mergers. We will find these seeds to be very important in determining the formation epoch of such structures, as it constrains the time of collapse to be constant in galaxies in general. Using observations in order to assess the importance of seeds for the formation of large-scale structure, I will review the simulation methods used in this review, which are based on the "Popular Eigenfrequencies" model. 
We present a systematic study of the gravitational well-being of the scattered light and scattering by its satellites and possible possible redshifts of these satellites. Our focus is on the effect of scattering photons on the angular momentum transport in the Jovian system of the Galilean satellites. We find that the signal is large enough to have significant effects on the rotational velocity, but the measurement of the average angular momentum flux, for a circular orbit of these satellites, is not a direct probe of the orbital motion of these satellites. We also estimate the probability that they have an origin in the Jovian stellar disc. The main result is that the direct measurement of angular momentum flux in the system of the Galilean satellites has difficulties obtaining a satisfactory signal. 
Stellar interaction during the Big Bang represents one of the great opportunities to explore the physical processes that drive the formation of stars. Dark energy offers the potential to answer the question: how can our Universe form and evolve? By means of tidal forces and through dynamical friction between planets and their stars we can draw an obvious answer. In this study, we consider all four initial states of the Standard Model of the Universe, namely the early Universe, the decoupling transition from gravitation to gravity, the time-interaction instability, and the most recent decades of cosmic evolution.We analyze numerically for all of these initial states and find that most stars may still form through their interaction with their host dark matter halo. More importantly, we suggest that the evolution of such stars represents a potentially powerful tool for constraining dark energy parameters. 
The cosmological evolution of the massive halo and of its cosmological environment may be intimately related. But there is no stable scenario where such evolution occurs simultaneously. Numerical simulations show that a universe with no dark energy, characterized by both a moderate and a high inflationary epoch, remains an artifact of the beginning of inflation. 
A new method for the analysis of inflationary cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps and the reconstruction of the gravitational potential (PDF) is developed. The method is based on the uncertainty in the primordial curvature perturbation and the accuracy of the reconstruction. The prediction of a model with a chaotic superposition of cosmic strings that holds for $\sim 5\%$ of the volume and the shear of the universe depends on the PDF power spectrum. This method allows to study the nature of large-scale structure in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) density field. The method is compared to previous approaches and considered the problems with tensor-to-scalar ratio. The result shows that a phantom phantom model is much more promising in the Einasto-Fermi direction, and allows to study the peculiar mode of inflation, if the point-like curvature perturbation can be known. 
We present a novel inflationary scenario in which scalar-tensor theories of gravity are coupled to matter. Here we follow the de Sitter standard model, which represents a generalization of the problem, and study the cosmological evolution of the scalar field, which includes inflation and dark energy. We study the evolution of cosmological parameters with and without gravity by employing the Datalogar-Lifshitz approach. We show that the de Sitter-standard model may be a viable candidate to explain the observations of the Cauchy black hole in the two-point correlation function of the Universe. 
Using a background-dependent equation of state, we study the first-order field theories with light electromagnetic and light antiparticles whose pre-heating time follows the linear attractor. The minimum and maximum values of the coupling energy remain unknown, and the corresponding equations of state from LambdaCDM are solved simultaneously. The dark matter density ($\Omega_{\rm DM}$) is obtained by assuming that the order-of-magnitude couplings are well modeled by the metric symmetry breaking around $2<z<6$. Since the growth of energy at large scales is a fundamental condition for an inflationary model, there is a special case where the most important field properties in general cannot be studied because they arise as a result of exotic inflationary scenarios. 
If a world, which is not simply a "superfluid", is a `classical' Einstein quark body (a type Ia superfluid), then an intrinsic Standard Model quark field undergoes Quantum Gravity effects, which alter the structure and dynamics of matter. In this framework, inflationary signatures of primordial curvature perturbations by quantum gravity can be observed.   Thus, no such effects can be inferred from our knowledge of cosmological structure, the curvature perturbations, or from the standard cosmology. 
We investigate the space potential in modified gravity and the primordial peculiar velocity dispersion relation of the massless scalar field, which we call modified dark energy. Our analysis takes the form of a localized expansion of the expansion factor \omega; we find a local vacuum singularity, which leads to the period of the expansion. Furthermore, we analyze the dynamics of dark energy, focusing on its kinetic coupling to non-accelerating fluids, and find that the potential is invariant. We propose a method to infer the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the scalar field during inflation, by using the negative sign of $\Omega$, and show that such a ratio is independent of any fixed degree of freedom parameter. We also discuss how this change affects the mass, and find that it can only be affected if the Minkowski constant $\omega = 0$. 
In Riemann-squared gravity (RGS), inflation is driven by a shear-only holographic perfect fluid, which under the assumption of an imposed minimal potential introduces a tilt into the equation of state. Here, we consider the perturbation theory (PT) with the flat Friedmann and Goldstone dimensions. For a normal torsion field, we have a novel limit, \epsilon, in which the PBH, calculated from equation of state with \torsion, is a spectrum of theta, that varies by linear factor in mass and bounce potential. It is shown that for real values of \torsion, perturbations due to \epsilon can easily be incorporated and thus produce the constant scalar tensor perturbations of RGS. 
The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from neutron star mergers (NSMs) through their associated binary black hole systems (BH-BH binary systems) are the fundamental tests of black hole physics. To date, however, neither the pulsar frequencies nor the relative distribution of the spin periods of the binary components are expected to be an ideal probe of the inspiral rate of the neutron star. To address this need, in an effort to precisely follow the orbital periods of neutrino-neutrino pair black hole mergers and therefore search for gravitational waves, the pulsar frequencies are used to determine the orbit parameters for an even more accurate binary black hole merger approach. In this work, we describe the planned goals and objectives of this work. The goal is to discover for the first time gravitational waves signals from GRBs, allowing for more accurate orbital and timing analysis of GWs with high signal-to-noise ratio. 
We present a comparison between gravitational-wave (GW) and LISA instruments on beam frequency bandwidths of 1000 Hz to 600 GHz (5e5 GHz to 1e3 GHz), requiring the ability to use them as a well-trained probing apparatus. However, the same ability to derive an error-corrected beam frequency as from observing GWs to study stellar spin evolution is required when analysing LISA's potential. We conclude that LISA alone can resolve the broad-band neutron star mergers problem, but with an extra need to search for GW signals in the shorter wavelength regime that would yield an accurate estimation of the underlying black hole model (which represents black hole energy density and gravitational-wave power spectra). 
We study in detail the physical conditions of an evolving power law-dominated super-Eddington universe model, which in most respects holds for relativistic and $\Lambda$CDM theories. Under the influence of new physics, we show that the equations governing the evolution of gravity are remarkably self-similar in the standard toy power law approximation, as the dependence of the redshift of expansion in the universe on the ratio of spin to matter is less significant than expected. Such a dependence on dark energy, weak lensing, and dark energy density also become detectable for certain cosmological conditions. We briefly discuss a possible mechanism to explain the absence of perturbations in such a model. 
We explore the unified gravity and cosmological mechanism necessary to explain the acceleration of cosmic rays (CRs) in the Universe. On the other hand, the evolution of magnetic fields in the universe allows us to adopt the classical theory of magnetic fields, which considers the variation of the density of the Universe. We first analytically calculate the acceleration of cosmic CRs in the Palatini formalism, valid for any magnetic field. Then we calculate the rate of CR acceleration in different cosmologies and compare with the cosmological statistics. Finally, we analyse a recently proposed scenario of cosmic CR acceleration: namely, the non-linear distortion of the cosmic background magnetic fields that surrounds the Cosmic Loop in a non-trivial way. 
Cosmological simulations of two dimensional Bianchi-type II systems, albeit in an external potential, are presented. The equations of state are formulated and the equations of motion are compared with the standard virial modal equations of state. By means of a distance analysis, we calculate the distances in the range $L/R$ to 4 halos of an OmegaCDM cosmology. 
The present study is aimed at finding statefinder parameters for the quintom dark energy model. It includes a determination of the $BH_0$ phenomenology and we show its equations of state via a parametric interaction with a power-law spectrum. It is shown that it is possible to recover the right cosmological model (or equivalently the de Sitter scenario) in the running of the spectrum, in the absence of a second order running of the spectrum, which is present in the $\Lambda$CDM model as well as the Ricci scalar. 
In the current cosmological framework, there exists a powerful interaction of dark energy and holographic dark matter with our universe. Such interaction is characterized by a steeper evolution of the Universe, with the enhanced power of dark energy becoming more strongly correlated with its power in the past. This enhancement can be well approximated with a holographic dark energy model. In this paper, we study an exact and very efficient equation of state of a holographic dark energy model with a coupled gravity with effective scalar field. In particular, we solve the scalar field equations of state of our model with both leading and trailing terms and illustrate the different possible behavior of the degrees of freedom of the universe. Finally, we prove that the equation of state of our model with a curvaton is significantly different than the one of other alternatives proposed by other authors. 
The Newtonian exact solution is derived in principle for perturbations in the standard theory of gravity in the context of a rotating black hole around a black hole with a temperature. From the absolute solution we obtain only one general condition. If a black hole with a temperature is about 3 orders of magnitude larger than a Schwarzschild black hole, the energy flux density is modelled to be twice that of the black hole. If an arbitrarily large magnetic field is present, the energy flux density decreases. In the comparison with the Newtonian solution a black hole that is perfectly flat, and with a central horizon where all the energy is released, has a high energy cutoff: the black hole at most provides energy for a few times 10^{20} $ - 1 L$ of the total energy spectrum. 
We perform a detailed non-adiabatic numerical investigation of the dynamics of a classical spinning particle embedded in the Vaidya space-time. The critical importance of this coupling depends on the coupling equation between a self-interacting particle and an interstellar medium. We develop a new approach to compute the time dependence of this coupling using the large-scale collisional interaction in a time-dependent way. In addition, we investigate the fractional contribution of the interstellar-medium coupling as a function of time and show that the effect has strong dynamical consequences. 
We investigate axially symmetric relativistic accretion of a relativistic star composed of an axisymmetric matter field and several purely moving solutions, and study the effects of the presence of a non-relativistic, axisymmetric magnetic field at the black hole. In particular, we investigate the effect of the external magnetic field strength on the asymmetric dynamics and the inspiral rate of the star. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of the formation of the strange magnetospheres of stars with axisymmetric magnetic fields, which would eventually form strange magnetars. For this purpose, we find that there exists a possibility of the existence of gravitating cylindrical, axisymmetric, axisymmetric compact objects in a star formed with a relativistic, non-relativistic, axisymmetric magnetic field. 
We review the development of Einstein's general relativity with both generalization of Einstein's general theory for slow expansion, and a study of the relative impact on the Universe of modifications to the Einstein's equations and the formation of large-scale structures. We compare with earlier efforts, presenting details of various effects on the power spectrum of linear perturbations in the radiative universe. For this context, we stress the importance of the Einstein theory for issues of structure formation. We also discuss how structure formation contributes to the one-loop evolution of matter, the Hubble expansion rate, and the dark energy equation of state. Finally, we give some initial work in improving analytic and numerical implementations of the general theory. 
The constraints on the Einstein-aether model and its prediction depend on many aspects, e.g., the exact form of the parameter space $f(\phi)$, and the spectral index $\beta\sim 0.01$ of the modified gravity model $c_2$ in the presence of a $V(\phi)$ gauge expectation. We demonstrate how it is possible to have the same constraint on the gauge-invariant form $\phi$ in the presence of a $V(\phi)$ gauge expectation in different two-dimensional contexts. We consider a number of problems, which allows to obtain different constraints on these three-dimensional models. In particular, a N-body simulation of the Galactic Center spiral structure, having $F(R) = R^{2.4}h_{72}t_{75}$, yields a tight constraint on the Einstein-aether gravity model at the mean distance $r_m=1.0^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$ degrees. In addition, in spite of the fact that this reference model is dominated by inflation, one of the important effects of the horizon of the Galaxy is the large scale polarization. Moreover, the existence of an observed correlation between the scale height of the galaxy and the angular velocity dispersion of its black hole, $r_{\rm blackhalo}$, implies that at early times the lensing effect of the black hole is of a dark matter origin, which is resolved at present. The correct treatment of $f(\phi)$ is also provided by a self-consistent treatment of lensing signatures in modified gravity models. 
Using a long-standing cosmological principle that is one of the foundations of the general relativity (GR) theories we review the method of finding exact solutions of the scalar field equations of Einstein-de Sitter gravity. We adopt the standard Einstein--de Sitter generalized theory and use exact solutions of the Einstein--de Sitter gravity theories to investigate two types of modified gravity theories, bimodal gravity and general relativity (GRG), as well as brans-Dicke (BD) gravity theories. The generalization of the canonical Einstein--de Sitter gravity model with Brans--Dicke is also extended to the case of perfect vacuum. Using the exact solutions of the Einstein--de Sitter gravity theories we compare the available constraints on the parameters of these theories. We find that, for a given Hubble parameter, there exists two types of modified gravity theories, $\omega$- and $\gamma-b$. For $\omega$ the scalar field is invariant, whereas for $\gamma$ it is not. For $\omega$ it is invariant for all potentials with finite vacuum pressure and the Hubble parameter $h_{\rm min}$ is of order $h^{-3/2}$. For $\omega$ the allowed parameter ranges are $k_{0,k_\mathrm{eff}} = (1+2) \log k_{eff} (h_{\rm min}-0.8)$ and $k_{0,k_\mathrm{eff}}= (2+3) \log k_{eff} (h_{\rm min}-0.3)$. This finding is compatible with most previous studies of flat universe solutions. 
The analysis of simulated radiation is performed for finite frequency density of liquid crystal dust of a sunspot as well as a solar flash. We consider low ionization levels, namely those of CO(0.2-0.3), HCN(0.2-0.3), CNO(0.3-0.4), and CH$_4$(0.3-0.4) at very low temperatures and from high mass, in order to explore the background radiation and to measure the physical dependence of this radiation spectrum on temperature. Based on the comparison of our data with available data, we assume that the background radiation is due to the bursting of a special convective ejecta that loops up from the sunspot limb. We study three sets of potential configurations of the radiation spectrum: (1) an optically thin bottom-drag with a non-polar ratio of 100^-15 - 400^-20 in one of the stratosphere layers, with a temperature higher than in the Sun (up to several hundred Kelvin in the case of the first assumption); (2) a top-heavy bottom-drag with the characteristic strength of 80^-13 or 70^-16 K in a transition layer, in the range 10^6-10^7 cm^{-3}, with a temperature higher than the ocean layer or to the ice layers. Both configurations are consistent with the present situation of no snow on the Sun. In the sunspot layer we have obtained optical spectra for hydrogen-rich and He-rich ejecta with spectral indices lower than those obtained by Snowy (1989), suggesting that the initial thermal photoionization rate of both ejecta is about 1000 K yr^-1. 
Dark matter is a very interesting constituent of the Universe. In the era of quantum computer hardware, it could be either particle-dominated or possibly used as a new mechanism of cosmic evolution. Cosmological models are mainly made up of vector-gravitons. If these particles colliding with the Universe, they would decay into dark matter, which has a large impact on the Universe. This has several implications. First, it would open up the possibility of performing direct measurements of the dark matter in the low- and high-redshift Universe. Second, for vector gravitons, it would provide a great physical constraint on the equation of state of dark matter. Third, vector gravitons can be used to search for gravitational waves from Dark Matter. As a byproduct of this work, we investigate the covariance of gravity violation, general covariance of scalar field and vector dark matter in two viable scenarios: axion-like dark matter or vector dark matter without a halo or a dark halo. We consider the two scenarios according to several scenarios of cosmology and compare their respective results. We show that the collisionless matter content of this model can provide strong constraints on the equation of state of dark matter in the very early Universe and the probability density at the end of inflation. 
Numerical relativity at the field level may be a viable tool to characterize cosmological fluctuations as well as the curvature perturbations. Nevertheless, a model of cosmological oscillations, namely N-body general relativistic fluid, is not yet fully implemented in most gravity-dynamical theories. It is crucial that an exact method of numerical relativity, namely {\it Curvature Radiation Dynamics}, is to be developed to address problems of cosmological evolution and structure formation with N-body theories, in particular, to describe gravitational waves in relativistic fluids. In this paper, we review a widely used numerical scheme called {\it Curvature Radiation Dynamics} (FRED). This is an accurate approach to describe, numerically, the small-scale structure and evolution of matter, for N-body theories. We present details of FRED, including the parameterization and time-resolved numerical results of the waveform fit. Using FRED, we reconstruct the potential surface of the fluid and the acceleration of the wavefront and a signal from the radio dipole field. Our models that correspond to spherically symmetric, accelerating, static and non-relativistic plasma can be used to describe the evolution of matter and the curvature perturbations in relativistic fluids, in particular to constrain and estimate the modes and the phase space distribution function in the theory. Our models describe the structures and the dynamics of cosmological fluctuations, in particular a power-law with index 1/N-max and a spectral index between -1.5 and 1.1. We conclude with a discussion of the sensitivity of {\it Curvature Radiation Dynamics} in explaining the phenomenology of the large-scale structure and the mechanism of its enhancement with time. 
We present a detailed set of radiative transfer equations for cosmological hydrodynamics using a stochastic initial flow model of Yang-Mills fields. As expected, thermal Kelvin-Helmholtz fluctuations due to a large flow within the flow are unable to be neglected, and thus lead to a transition into pure Kelvin-Helmholtz solutions at early times (dynamical timescales greater than the observable expansion timescale), thus leaving the source of their emission as a luminous source of mixing. In order to separate this effect from the less significant thermal, non-luminous effects, we use Monte Carlo simulations with the modified code Helioseismic and Magnetic Reconnection. The semi-analytical radiative transfer equations show that the mixing discontinuity between the Yang-Mills and Kelvin-Helmholtz velocities grows with time, even in the absence of phase transitions. This indicates that the thermal Kelvin-Helmholtz signal may eventually be relevant as a probe of cosmological cosmology. It also provides a signal for the thermal convection zone as an indicator of particle motion and concentration near the interface between two massive inter-ice walls. 
The stellar companion of a binary pulsar emits gamma rays that are probably excited in the interstellar medium, which can be used to probe the masses of neutron stars, millisecond pulsars, and ultra-light astronomical objects. However, until recently, the parametrisation to determine the ratio between the period of neutron star radiated by the companion star and the pulsar-to-black hole mass ratio was difficult. We present an improved method for modelling this parameter, motivated by the wide variety of dynamical phenomena affecting neutron star binaries in particular. We post-process pulsar system models from literature to investigate the effects of the eccentricity on the non-trivial parameter, $d_{0}$, of the neutron star spin period, $\gamma$, which, for all relevant angular momentum conservation laws, depends on the pulsar's orbital momenta. The model reproduces the amplitude of $d_{0}$ of the neutron star system, $\gamma$ can be as large as 1.06 dex. 
We present a numerical study of gravitational waves (GWs) arising in inspiralling relativistic jets from a binary with an ultrarelativistic magnetic field of mass of order 100 GeV, describing the evolution of the jet and the expansion of the outflow from one of the inspiralling pulsars to the other. In this model, radiation of the relativistic electrons and photons decouple rapidly and the core is produced and a low-order dual-photon process occurs. Radiation from the interacting central supermassive black hole, visible as a bow shock, is decoupled from energy in the jet, opening the standard accretion disk scenario. The resultant waves are compared with a model in which the accretion flow modifies the strength of the magnetic field. The kinetic energy released in the jet can exceed the gravitational energy of the black hole. The main result is that GWs in a mildly relativistic phase of inspiraling jets at high luminosities can be produced with an accuracy approaching 1 sigma, reaching from ~10-20 eV in the Gamma-ray band. 
We study thermodynamics of static black objects in Dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (DGF). Our work is based on the {\it study} of Lambda particle de Sitter models, a novel approach where a point compact (in DHD) (1D), cosmological, fluid-dominated fluid perturbations is propagated as a fluid and unperturbed as a particle. We consider homogeneous stationary observers, and non-negative critical points. Our data are obtained in a scheme which approximates the density and the temperature of a static black object. It is found that for the example of a celestial body, one can obtain, in principle, the well-known generalized form of the temperature $T_{\rm eff} \equiv \alpha$ (by summing the density and the temperature of particles) by a simple formula. We also investigate DGF data in the null Lagrangian for arbitrary homogeneous sources. The numerical results are then applied to two simple structure parameter solutions: one in the initial data, and one corresponding to the point compact configuration. In particular, the true equation of state of static black objects is found to be located in $r = r^{-1} \rightarrow r^{-1}$. This form has a negligible contribution on the matter power spectrum, so the limits for both energy density and mass of matter are smaller. 
It is proposed that our Universe has a large expansion rate at a low redshift of $z=2$. To explain this acceleration, various mechanisms must be included. The so-called Lambda-CDM models have a reduced energy budget and leave their constituents with less and more compact galaxies than in the standard picture. Various possible explanations for this phenomenon are discussed. The possible future acceleration is shown to be due to a combination of cold dark matter (CDM) models. The fate of our Universe, as well as the acceleration mechanism, depends critically on the properties of our own galaxy and thus on the assumptions of our standard cosmology. 
It has recently been shown that the variation of the cosmological constant in the late-time cosmic acceleration process can be attributed to an extra acceleration leading to a maximum mass as observed in the multi-wavelength spectrum of the Universe. It is argued that this model makes predictions for the minimum mass, $\sigma_{max}$, in the Universe that are very similar to that in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations. It is found that such cosmological constant can imply a minimum mass, $\sigma_{min}= 0.3 \pm 0.1$ m$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ for models with and without any matter density. This contradiction is disfavored if this model is valid at lower cosmological redshifts. It is also found that the Universe is slightly reduced at early times, but the observed values of the cosmological constant can be resolved in the near future. 
Asteroids provide an important probe for general relativity in many astrophysical settings, which are usually considered to be the dominant objects in cosmological observations. The aim of this work is to compare the results of various analyses of the cosmological time series in the metric formalism by reconstructing the lifetime of the dark energy equation of state (EOS) using or without a cosmological constant. In addition, we present the limitations and assumptions on the model fitting method adopted by the study. This approach allows us to test the corresponding standard cosmological constant model for the tensor to scalar ratio and the amplitude of the linear scale invariance (LSA) parameter, in the light of earlier work. It can also be used to construct an analytical expression of the volume of the Universe at zero cosmological time, in the light of the extended approximation discussed in Szekeres, Solow and Baxi. We show how the results can be compared with different cosmological models, in particular one with a flat universe (computed from the gravitational action) or a one with an expanding universe (computed from the matter conservation equation). 
The possibility of the post-minkowski action for the constituent post-merger objects of an extended multi-star system is investigated. The equation of state for a saddle point with an imaginary potential for the combined region of the primary and secondary stars of the primary is calculated. The post-merger is explicitly formulated by using the proposal of Chaplygin gas diffusion. The properties of the spherical solution of the gravitationally polarised phase equations are calculated using the total of the new candidate post-merger members. The pair of additional post-merger stars is considered, which allows for the possibility of evolution of the system after the formation of the generalized relativistic secondary of the secondary star. 
We show that the bounce of a $f(R)$ metric in the Einstein frame gives rise to a generic acceleration of the Universe in the $f(R)$ frame of a metric-affine f(R) gravity. Since the adiabatic fluctuations in the field of the two density perturbations are stationary, it is clear that the non-perturbative effect and acceleration of the Universe can be completely screened. We find that the acceleration of the Universe in the Einstein frame is valid in all the forms of the inflaton field and the scalar field. 
We study the evolution of spacetime with the geometry and energy density of matter, with the singularity of the Ricci scalar Lagrangian as an example. The behavior of spacetime at the $N$ dimension is examined with two possible solutions: one is a unitary (or power-law) solution that is a power-law and the other a static one, both of which lead to a zero gravity at the $N$ dimension. This model is extended for other scalar-to-interaction production. The one that we have found is a solution for non-zero gravity, but it is not necessarily a null gravity case. The analysis shows that the explicit example of a static/isothermal space (mechanical) solution leads to the development of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) framework, where all the matter is replaced by fluid dynamics, and thus the cosmological dynamical density of matter is conserved. Such dynamical stability is extended to involve unitary solutions and to the re-stationarity, i.e. time dependent deviations from FRW description, of density fluctuations. The condition for the presence of unitary solutions is quantified and we discuss the consequences of the models for various cosmological phenomena. The derived formalism is related to the evolution of the density of matter for real big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). The allowed deviations from FRW and consequent weak field, since both of them are non-zero, are then present. In the matter limit, the presence of non-zero gas density produces cosmological fluctuations dominated by the evaporation of volume and energy of matter, and hence leads to a value of the density fluctuation amplitude which implies the existence of dark matter. 
We show that in realistic relativistic neutrino mass-bounds it is possible to relax the equation of state of neutron stars to core-collapse black holes or to the thermally unstable of an external fluid. This relaxation can overcome the finite condition for compactness; however, only relativistic compressibility can explain its fundamental dynamical properties. 
Recent observations of large scale structure using the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) demonstrate that Loop models are of special interest for understanding the cosmic structure, including their dependence on cosmological parameters. Some of the predictions of such models may be rejected from recent observations by using the Braneworld cosmological model. We first present a phenomenological estimate of the effects of loops on WMAP measurements. We show that in the context of MCMC (MCMC) with a regular cosmological constant of low normalization and parameter space $f_{\text{eff}}=\frac{2}{\frac{d^{2}}}{d\text{E}}$ and Lema\^\circ$ (LEM) method for Loop models, Loop models do not affect WMAP-derived theoretical constraints and hence constraints on Loop models become weaker, and hence higher, by assuming $f_{\text{eff}}$ values for the values of the cosmological constant, $k = 0$ and scale $l$. In addition, in the context of a loop-inflationary model with loop dark energy with parameters of a baryonic and baryon dark energy and parameter space $f_{\text{eff}}=0$, and allowing for large scale structures the cosmic dimension constraint becomes higher. Finally, for the full scale of the universe $k<1$ we confirm that the Planck-Lema\^\circ$ potential is the most promising candidate for Loop models. 
The general nature of the cosmological perturbation is analysed in two ways: one aimed at (i) strengthening the cosmological applicability of cosmological perturbations in current and future relativity experiments; and another aiming to improve the sensitivity of future measurements to cosmic-ray physics, in particular in the energy density of high-redshift particle accelerators, thanks to the "neutrino", minimal mixing approximation. 
We present analytically how the exact equations of motion (EoS) are constructed in general relativity, and how these EoS are related to the dynamics of the radiation field using simple nonlinear techniques. We use the general relativity formalism to study the probability distributions of a set of equations, and point out some distinct statistical properties of the sets of equations. We also present two approximate approaches that could be applied to this scenario in the statistical sense. 
Accurate measurements of the first observable neutrino equation of state are also important. Their measurement using only the magnetic fields of the terrestrial planets is interpreted as an illustration of the infalling source of angular momentum from the central mass of the planet. Since that interpretation is contingent on the precise interpretation of the observations, one may expect some surprises, such as rapid decay in the linear or azimuthal direction. In this work we seek to clarify that description by comparing observations of both a body of water as well as a massive body in relativistic shock waves. For hydrodynamical experiments, the independent directions of the waves are derived from the possibility that the body is moving in a different and retrograde direction than a conical body. This predicts that observations are inaccurate. We infer that when the resulting integral becomes a slight doublet, the four points of motion are moving with a peculiar and intermittent behavior and, possibly, exhibiting a sudden change in the usual patterns of the wave equation. Although this behavior could be easily explained by several mechanisms, it is inconsistent with the expected pattern of behavior when the right terms are introduced in the wave equation. In the present work, our results lead to a discussion of the possible implications for the origin of the shock wave signatures in spacetime. 
We explore the feasibility of observing inspiral of an object with an r-dimensional gravitational potential where a boundary discontinuity is maintained by the tidal interaction, including the possibility to observe the core. We employ the Triton Planck experiment to follow the inner boundary of such a model. The total gravitational potential M_N=10^{-13} M_{\odot} is generated by rotating binaries of the same mass and angular momentum. Aperiodic star inspirals are also studied by measuring the moments of inertia LIRIGO-Virgo. The inspiral periods correspond to the central engine's heliocentric distance of 13,000 AU. We find that when applying a toy-based approach to calculating the inspiral periods in a more realistic gas drag limit, the inspiral times scale with the velocity of the stellar wind. This new approach can be employed to probe the gravitational instability mechanism that drives inspiral of a strange object in such a large-scale potential. 
The Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati gravity of Hernquist theory introduces a negative derivative for the number of new particles $n$ and an anti-correlation of the effective parameter $m$ with the intrinsic orbital period $P_A$ which gives a constant value of $P_A$. Here we quantify this effect and calculate the orbital periods of 2 test particles $n \ge 1$ and 2 weakly coupled. For each particle, it is clear that the best-fit value $P_A \ge 1$ is found to be $P_A \lesssim 10^{-10}$. By comparing the obtained orbital period for all the different groups of particles, we also discuss the distribution of their best orbital periods and present a method for estimating these values. 
We reanalyze the first two claims in the Cosmic Microwave Background Cosmological Experiment (CMBC) data, made by Robert Schopenhauer and presented by Paul Schmidt, in which the Wigner potential $w(z)$ is explicitly $w$-invariant and the flatness parameter $H(z)$ itself as an independent parameter. The result shows that, in the presence of non-axisymmetric expansion of a homogeneous set of initial conditions and the presence of the tension, the Einstein potential $w(z)$ provides a true two-valued function of $h$ and $H(z)$ for the first time. We show that this allows us to reject the flatness parameters as being naturally stable and generically isotropic and and instead find a satisfactory linear form for the tensor modes $p_{\gamma}$ which is consistent with the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre (FLRW) cosmology. 
We investigate the gravitational field of dark matter. We show that the scalar field perturbation and the field tensor perturbation with flat spatialities do not significantly affect the matter density field and consequently its amplitude. We also show that the system growth of the dark matter is fully accounted for in models with scalar fields in a non-linear cosmology. For such non-linear dark matter models, the cosmological constant appears to be suppressed at late times. We show that the cosmological constant is enhanced when the scalar field field decelerates to values below the Hubble parameter in a mass range of M_x/M_R_e < 0.3. If the dark matter content of dark energy is dominated by a singular scalar field, the observed distribution of the extra baryons in the cosmic microwave background is well reproduced by a linearised Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. We then study the gravitational potential of dark matter by analysing the results of a simulation of galaxy formation. The value of the dark matter density in the early universe has a strong dependence on the model parameters such as the density of dark matter halos, mass of dark matter substructures, and other relevant parameters. We find that models with a moderately non-zero mass parameter and a small cosmological constant do not significantly modify the matter density if dark matter density $n \gtrsim 1.2\times10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ halo masses are assumed to be in the range $0.6-3.1$. The cosmological constant exhibits a sharp decrease in the number of dark matter substructures, as the number of dark matter substructures increases. 
The presence of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) at the non-linear scales that is responsible for the large-scale structure formation in the Universe has attracted the attention of different research institutes. In this paper, we perform a correlation analysis based on the combined effect of two-dimensional (2D) potentials and the stochastic GW signal coming from GW detectors at the frequencies of the two orders of magnitude above where the GW signal is expected to occur. This approach predicts the expected GW signal and the expected sensitivity of several parameter sets to the evolving background. The combined analysis is based on recent developments for upcoming GW detectors, and we present the results of the analyses for all the key bands expected in the coming months. 
We present new methodology for measuring gravity effects in a gravitational light-ray deflection experiment by exploiting the consistent coincidence of the two light rays reflected off a point source and an oblique deflection sphere in the light of a strong gravitational field with the barotropic spacetime in each observer. Our method has been applied to the generation of dynamic, superluminal, and deformable deformable gravity metrics. The resulting metric is the brane at the horizon of a point source whose existence is connected to that of the observer. The formula for this metric is that of gravimagnetism. We tested our method on realistic simulated GR potentials and derived constraints on different classes of estimators of the intrinsic gravity effect in the case of a distance modulus of order 500 $m$ from the observer. 
The idealization of General Relativistic theories of gravity are reviewed in terms of the effects of multipoles in the propagation of the light velocity. The field of radiation fields has a prominent presence and its importance decreases with the strength of the light propagation field. The more antisymmetric light propagation field occurs in the case of inhomogeneous radiation. The light propagation is unstable and only angular momentum conservation effects are operative. By combining the results of Vlasov, Ho-Maadov, & Narayan, we confirm that the three-dimensional (3D) theory is well-suited to describe astrophysical light propagation and discuss the characteristic particle geometries for these possible geometries. 
We have studied the collapse of a mixture of gas and dust around a young rapidly rotating star forming in radiation-dominated environments of hot Jupiters. We compute the collapse timescales with hydrodynamical simulations in terms of the gas density in the initial disk, the bulk viscous viscosity parameter $\gamma$, and the fraction of mass in the disk. We find that $\gamma = 1\log\alpha$ for small $\gamma$, for the form of the clouds and for the locations of bulk viscosity in the disk, and $1/2< \gamma < \gamma/c$. For moderate $\gamma$, the system may collapse much later, leading to the formation of large enough subsonic cloud masses ($M_{cloud} > 10^{10.5}$~cm$^{-3}$). A simple model for the mass and velocity distributions of the initial cloud is constructed, for the disk and for an early formation phase (1 Gyr) of a cold diffuse medium of initial density $\rho_c\sim -10^7$~cm$^{-3}$ in stellar disks, corresponding to a phase of gas-grain size $\sim \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. If the particle acceleration is $\langle \gamma\rangle \rangle \rangle \rangle \gamma/c \rangle$, the gas may be compressed in the disk, or expelled back by a wind of the supermassive black hole. Since the initial medium is partly ionized by the wind, the required mass is sufficient to drive supernova outflows, producing large mass-loss rates. 
The cosmological constant problem has been regarded as a direct consequence of the non-local evolution of the universe. As is well known in recent astrophysics, the critical equation for the observable effect of cosmic inflation is presented. 
Several parameters describing slow-roll inflation, such as the square of the speed of light and the energy density, have been derived from the data of the WKB algorithm for inelastic inflation. They are calculated for different inflationary regimes and some features in the maximum multipoles are discussed. These parameters have been computed from data with $M_x \approx 0.07 \pm 0.01$ and their dependence on the inflationary regime is checked. Different inelastic modes can be described for a wide range of inflationary parameters, the range of the inflationary energy density, the rolling mass function of inflation and the WKB power spectrum are also explored. Several results of the inflationary calculations have been reported and given in a following papers. 
In this paper, we study the role of quantum effects in the quantum mechanics problem in the context of a braneworld cosmology, based on the simplest braneworld in the Horndeski metric, and the four new cosmological observations, and our approach to the calculation of the cosmic microwave background radiation and dark matter. To account for the quantum background effects, we also constrain cosmological parameters $\Omega$, $\Omega_0$, $w$ of the primordial black hole, $\Omega_\Lambda$ and the dark energy equation of state, and discuss the results obtained in this context. 
This study probes the perspectives of testing the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati gravity model (DGP) with the outer planets of the Solar System. The model combines the key theoretical ideas of Rvali-Gabadadze, Hildegard, Slecherbuchler and Theologus-Cosmos in the physics of the gravitational field of the solar system. The model makes use of the 4+1 physics and 2+1 spacetime potential in a newly developed way with an axi-symmetric differential equation. As examples, we study the application of our theory to the outer planets of the Solar system using the upcoming Kepler spacecraft mission and work in which we performed a detailed orbit-filling analysis. We also investigate the possibility to use this model for a direct probe of the stability and the mass-loss properties of the outer planets of the Solar system. 
Aplysis of three-dimensional neutrino energy distributions is performed in the Fermi region. The theory is based on a simple analysis of a set of steady-state compact sources. These binaries are then investigated using the theory-paper of Helbig Higgs systems. An excellent agreement of the mean of $N$-body numerical and numerical hydrodynamical results is achieved, including a complete relaxation of the system from relativistic to thermodynamic equilibrium. 
Following the construction of the current Universe we consider the decay of cosmological parameters in $H(z)$-LSS theory of gravity. It is shown that the galaxy population, and hence of the early Universe, has a decay rate consistent with that of slow-roll dark matter and non-gravitating extra dimensions. The decay rate scales in $B_c^2\rho_{\rm S}=k-r_{\rm S}^{1/4}$ in $H(z)$-LSS theory, thus in the presence of extra dimensions. We find that it follows that $H(z)$-LSS theory has a general behavior that changes the initial conditions of the gravitational wave background and amplitude perturbation in the non-gravitating model, which may enable us to explain some important constraints on cosmic-ray production from the early universe. 
We present a detailed investigation of the standard cosmological model, an exact version of the general framework of the Gaule-Sciama (GSS) model. We assume a static set of cosmological parameters by which there exist small exact solutions of the density problem. For the concrete case, the specific values of the lensing distance depend on the parameters which determine the absolute and linear curvature anisotropies and its large scale structure, respectively. After excluding energy spectra, the gaseous source mass remains stable at present and it is not needed to solve the full Einstein equations. The relative values of the cosmological parameters which can account for the large curvature anisotropies and their large scale structure are independent of the parameters which determine the total density, total mass density and total redshift evolution. The derived cosmological parameters are not dependent on the parameters which define the curved horizon. 
It is shown that a chaplygin coupling between gravitational waves and p-proton resonant pairs in matter can explain the cusp (or conifold) in the geometry of the Crab pulsar. Even though no such coupling exists, it can solve the equations of Poynting, Mukharin, Donoho & Hublands (2015), and it is demonstrated that in the curvature limit of the potential $\tau_{e}$ and $\tau_{B}$, the chaplygin coupling leads to dynamical (or kinetic) deformation. In the case of the chaplygin-dominated wave-particle (DGW) coupling, this is the outcome of the impact of the chaplygin coupling on a neutron star wind or onto a supernova (SN) host. 
The shape and spatial distribution of comoving jets in systems of binary systems represent a unique tool for quantifying the formation and evolution of black holes. The formation and evolution of a central black hole must therefore be characterized in a relevant manner. In this context, we show that the structure and properties of jets of brown dwarf binaries (BDs) and discs (CDs) can be studied with the near-infrared (NIR) and near-infrared spectroscopic observations. The formation and evolution of these black holes, by analogy with spherically symmetric systems, can be studied by using the quasi-parallel distribution function and Lagrangian hydrodynamic equations, respectively. 
Recent lensing data from three neutron star candidates (M31, M87 and M87A) provides further support for models of mass distribution by compact objects. Here, we explore the applicability of the simplest (static) model of gravitational lensing (with mass $M_{b}=0.2\pm 0.1\times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$) in the context of the recent high-cadence field galaxies at $z\sim 3$. First, we compute the likelihood that the compact object lensing results in a observed maximum field, and, under a number of assumptions, obtain the real case. Then, we consider static values of mass distributions (the square root of the lensing radius) and potentials corresponding to a non-singular mass distribution. The latter parameters are satisfied by modeling the magnification-corrected image, in terms of the degree to which each model obtains an improvement in its lensing spectra. While the advantages of static models over Spherical and Symmetric is demonstrated empirically, we conclude that models of mass distribution $M_{b}/M_{\rm s}>0.1\times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$ can not give the best likelihood on the expected magnitudes and magnitudes of the point sources at $\lesssim 3 \times 10^{11}$ mag. Finally, we propose a procedure, called bimetric follow-up, to quantify the correlations between lenses and mass distributions (magnitudes and lensing-corrected spectra). Bimetric follow-up for M31 alone provides an upper limit of $1.5\times10^{-12}$ mag, which is comparable to the difference for the correlations obtained with a uniform mass distribution (to the latter limit). While the non-spherically symmetric lens lens model (`de Sitter') may ultimately lead to a more effective exploration of galaxy halo systems, we have demonstrated that, given a sufficiently realistic density profile and finite duration of the lensing events, its validity for testing modified gravity is likely much weaker, especially when the large density profile and wide dispersion of the lensing sources is considered. 
We present results from the Halpha (1.4 mm) and [FeII] line spectra of 44 clusters at z<1.4 in the H2 regions of the nearby galaxy DSS and 2MASS to investigate their membership and potential cluster members. All of these clusters show pronounced dust emission which is believed to originate from early/stellar evolutionary stages of their host galaxies. The Halpha emission of the Halpha-selected field galaxies seems to have passed through and directly integrated through the non-gravitational interaction of the two galaxies; therefore we conclude that most of these new gas giant clusters are cluster members. 
We present a new estimate of the masses of the progenitors of Pioneer 10/11, produced by direct gravitational lensing, and do so with a conservative assumption of non-random particle number density. A robust theoretical framework is presented that satisfies the observational constraints, while obtaining realistic numerical solutions. 
The mechanism by which a solar system satellite selects an orbiting body is unclear. The existence of a secondary body in the system, during the solar system's time, may have a secondary (super-Earth) with a geometric or kinetic origin. It is still under debate whether a pseudo-hydrodynamical model should be used to explain these phenomena. We propose that the existence of a pseudo-hydrodynamical system is an independent possibility: i) it could be discovered at much higher times, (ii) it could be detectable for the first time, and (iii) the nature of the secondary system would be studied with unprecedented sensitivity. We have constructed a model in which solar system satellites reveal an orbiting body with a different orientation than those found at present. We apply this model to two independent solar system tests, namely the Eclipse of 12 September 2006 and recent observations of M 1 with WIND. In the case of the Solar System test, we report that, if an Earth satellite also rolls into orbit, there could be a strong conflict between the 2 laws of a pseudo-hydrodynamical system. In contrast, if the secondary body in the system turns out to be the satellite of M 1, the claimed discrepancy is entirely excluded. 
The primary source of a strong scalar field is a moving potential field ($f$) associated with gravitational gravity. Its contribution depends on the couplings of $\phi$ to the potential, $\phi$, and in general has a different value between the squeezed density and the kinetic Lorentz force. A detailed study of this relationship will aid us in understanding and constrain the interaction model of a scalar field and its associated $\phi$. In this letter we consider cosmological acceleration in a $\chi^2$ scalar field. In this model, the CMB spectral energy distribution derived from $\delta$-CDM (or with other candidate measures) is given by: a) a uniform scalar field with energy $\sim 10^{56}$ eV, b) a large density of the local universe, c) a finite scalar field with energy $\sim 10^{51}$ eV and an upper limit to the $e$-folding speed $f$ that has a scale length $t$ proportional to the Hubble parameter. This allows to constrain the couplings of $\phi$ to the field $\phi$ in detail, and allows us to place constraints on a series of models which is not relevant to observational constraints. The model considered here is one of the gravitating $b$-tensor models, but allows to resolve many still unresolved issues. 
As the mass of the Galaxy is estimated from the dust temperature measurements in the Milky Way Halo, it is a large quantity that can be measured and quantified through an accurate equation of state in the galactic halo. Even for light above the Mach limit, these quantities are still relevant to the cosmic chronometer, but can also be violated to better understand the evolution of the magnetic field in the Galaxy. This article reviews the history of the true value of Mach's Principle in the Galaxy and shows that Mach's Principle still applies even if most of the observable results come from the Galaxy. By comparing published data with the Mach force, we put some serious constraints on the effective Mach forces. Additionally, we emphasize the possible importance of theoretical limitations in any future observatory. 
While the Standard Model of particle physics is fully known, there are no "standard" alternatives. We propose a new formulation of the Standard Model particle physics that naturally arises from a spherically symmetric Newtonian potential. The solution of the Boltzmann equation involves two very distinct fluid components -- a smooth region of a spherical brane and a strange fluid -- with different mass distributions. The inner region of the brane acts as a geodesic in the surrounding medium, which is pressure-sensitive enough to prevent freeze out in the curved bubble. We also derive the geometry of the fluid -- i.e., the equation of motion for the fluid is described using an exponential theory. Both equations for the fluid are insensitive to a limiting geometry that can be of arbitrarily large size. 
It has been conjectured that the rotational period of the Chandrasekhar-mass braneworld which we refer to as a quintessence might exceed one thousand years, while in fact it could be several thousand years since the beginning of the formation of the braneworld. In order to solve this problem, we study the variation of the energy density of the total component of the Prandtl number. We find that the total component becomes heavier with increasing strength of the magnetic field that permeates the final state of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld, which leads to the compression and fragmentation of the system. 
We study the long term non-Gaussianity (LFO) from an intermediate scalar field (supernovae) and find that for regular and strongly non-Gaussian fields both non-Gaussianities decrease with distance, to be consistent with the observed times of type II supernovae. However, if the curvature is inhomogeneous (free rotation parameter <\geq -1) and the other degrees of freedom is small, the LFO becomes more anti-correlated. This similarity between the two type II supernovae (SNe Ia) cannot be accounted for by assuming that all gravity is either unmodeled or cold. We also discuss the contribution of non-Gaussianity and the fact that it is more strongly anti-correlated than the fluctuation rate of the form $f(T) \propto t^{n}$, and consider also relevant simple models, which predict non-Gaussianity directly from inverse tensor perturbations. 
We investigate the evolution of black-hole binaries without precision. We first show that in general any order in orbital parameters that alter the evolution of a black hole can readily lead to more efficient binary evolution and less hardening. We then estimate the stellar mass and radial distance and discuss the possibility of identifying different hot (up to 0.05 Msun) black holes with known masses, radii, and orbital periods. We find that effective spin-orbit conservation can modify the orbital evolution considerably for pulsars and Jupiters which are thought to contain an active, single star companion. This depends on the stability of the orbit. Binaries in eclipsing binaries will have large eccentricities, thus affecting the evolution of their orbital properties. Alternatively, eclipsing binaries will not have large eccentricities and spin-orbit conservation can lead to degeneracies between the orbital elements. If this occurs, our findings may further drive or accelerate the evolution of black hole binary systems, with notable consequences for massive binary evolution and their consequent tidal tails. 
During the last few years, we have learned of the existence of thermal modes in the relativistic winds of black holes, such as the Eta Carinae star. Such modes lead to an effect called the "diffusion effect". One of the principal candidates for the origin of this effect is the photon-electron scattering of photons. During a search for such scattering modes, we have found a number of significant cases of photon scattering. In particular, an evaluation of the linear polarization in the relativistic wind of a disc-magnetosphere density boundary at 40 GHz shows evidence of significant polarization of photons and produces an upper limit on the apparent polarization angle. 
When taking a late-time single-dish survey of the universe, we will know whether there are a number of significant quantities describing the expansion history of the Universe. These quantities include mass functions, scalar-tensor theory, the correlation function and a number of decelerating fields. We find, however, that the spatial scales predicted by these quantities predict less than 0.1% of the matter density perturbations and are even larger than the apparent distance to the Sun, the Hubble constant, and the star formation rate in the Galaxy. 
The angular momentum of rotating bodies is investigated using an appropriate approach that allows to consistently separate the secular and magnetohydrodynamic effects of perturbation of gravity in the adiabatic perturbation of gravity. The determination of the critical angular momentum of the system depends on the necessary correction for the poloidal perturbation perturbation to be applied. A new method based on the formalism of a system of perturbation perturbations and whose usage is based on general relativity is used in this work. The pre-Newtonian post-Newtonian corrections are calculated using a fixed post-Newtonian post-Newtonian law as input to the post-Newtonian procedure. The method is applied to the CMD of the contracting body of NRGR, including the pre-Newtonian and post-Newtonian post-Newtonian effects. The effective Hamiltonian equation and the method's formalism are tested on numerical simulations. The results show that the post-Newtonian post-Newtonian post-Newtonian corrections are possible in one solution of the contracting body and in a secondary one when the secular effects are taken into account in the dynamical calculation. 
We discuss the origin of the gravitational mass defect (IGM) for a class of models that contain a large-scale dark matter halo in the metric regime. We suggest three variants to explain the recently found mass of the galaxy galaxy group M33, its massive substructure, and its peculiar morphology, focusing on the Gravitational-Disintegration (GND) and other non-generalized alternatives. In all three variants, the halo was originally formed in a secular gravitational collapse which proceeded to form the gravitational instability (IGM). Since the initial mass was always larger than the tidal radius, the central density decreases very rapidly, which means that, even though the initial mass of the halo is large, it is strongly suppressed, rather than constituting a weak gravitational instability. In the latter case the halo contains a single dark matter halo which we are assuming is isotropic in cosmology. For example, the total dark matter component also starts to fragment to smaller numbers depending on the initial conditions. In addition, as the gravitational instability breaks down, the apparent total mass is set to the value usually adopted in massive models, which allows for a constraint on the potential of the cluster. The IGM formed by merging an earlier generation of dark matter halos at the end of the galaxy stage must also contain a strong, massive dark matter halo, due to the low initial angular momentum. 
Black holes are compact objects with masses between 100 and a few million solar masses. Gravitational lensing can be performed in these objects by constructing the curvature of the field which increases as the gravitational field decreases. In this paper, we illustrate the detection of gravitational lensing by Einstein-Born-Infeld black holes with gravitational lenses in the background light curves of CMB data taken from the LIGO and Virgo detectors. We show that for the Einstein-Born-Infeld (E-B) model, the linear lensing timescale is constant as small as $\rho\sim 1000$ s. For the lensing model with $f=3.4 \times 10^{-6}$ and $\sim 0.1 h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, this result corresponds to $\sim 33$ times more than the Hubble constant of the Schwarzschild spacetime at fixed angular size of black holes and $\sim 130$ times larger than the Hubble constant of the test mass black hole at the same distance. Our results show that there is a faint low limit on the fraction of black holes at the top of black hole space density peaks. In view of this limit, the lensing observations by CMB observations can constrain the stellar mass gap in distant galaxies. 
This letter presents an analysis of a conjectured universe in Einstein frame, which corresponds to an Minkowski metric-affine action. The theory extends a certain model of inhomogeneous motion (D) to the existence of gravity fields, with specific inertial frame (DM) for which the gravitational field generated in the aforementioned action is its photon derivative, namely, the de Vaucouleurs terms. We show that, unlike the D/D+1/R world, the DM becomes self-consistent in the Einstein frame. In particular, the cold dark matter fields do not modify the Universe at all, even when cosmological observables get altered by the D world. The general relativity assumption holds in this realization. Furthermore, it also applies to the Einstein frame, where the gravitational field is related to the equation of state, which is explicitly determined by the metric of the D world. 
Measurements of the gravitational constant by pulsars are notoriously difficult. After a brief review of the current state of knowledge, a number of theoretical reasons for gravitational constant measurement techniques and for methods which are proposed for the discrimination of binary pulsars may also be considered. Among them, a new measurement technique of orbital decay is being proposed by the GBT, which exploits long-period orbital decay to provide a consistent and independent measurement of the gravitational constant. In this paper, we perform a systematic search for variable pulsars by searching for a variation of the mass-radius-symmetry profile. We confirm previous determinations of the inclination angle using the \Lambda CDM model, and we compare our results to those obtained using the Palomar-Green Experiment. We confirm that orbital decay can discriminate an object that was long-perioded, suggesting a plausible mechanism for the common origin of long-period pulsars. While various techniques for the test of our predictions are still uncertain, we show that we have fully fitted the disc model of DGP-Porrati et al. and their current observational calibration parameters. 
We study the evolution of the three-tensor perturbations in the framework of two-component General Relativity. The latter may have three physical parameters, $n_{\rm E}$, $n_{\rm H}$, $n_{\rm V}$, and $n_{\rm A}$. We find that, for the case of two-component general relativity, two derivatives $n_{\rm H}$, $n_{\rm V}$, $n_{\rm A}$ and $n_{\rm A}$ grow as the background density increases, although the $n_{\rm H}$ appears unstable. The evolution of the three-tensor perturbations goes on almost continuously, with the corresponding evolution described in a large homogeneous manner. One consequence is that, once the density is lowered above the Eddington limit, the two-tensor perturbations remain in equal period. We conclude that the evolution of the three-tensor perturbations, after some calibration of the background density, is able to provide the basic characteristic of General Relativity. 
We propose a phenomenological model of cosmology where the various cosmological systems are described by a power law Eulerian power spectrum. We present the generalized Gaussian Universe-Ausp model and describe its interaction with baryon data. Within this model, two potential singularities emerge in a single singularity, one the Sagittarius Kuiper belt; the other the Taurus, which is a quintessence supermassive black hole. After considering an axion star model, we find the Einstein metric. We suggest that such a scenario can account for the existence of singularities in standard cosmology. 
The number of galaxies hosting ultra-light dark matter halos grows monotonically with cosmic time. The role of dark matter in galaxies needs to be thoroughly examined, the cosmological parameters required, and the constraints from galaxy clusters and dwarf galaxies. We performed simulations to estimate the number of dark matter-enhanced galaxies and quantify the effect of dark matter halo mass and specific star formation rate on the galaxy statistics. 
We consider an Einstein-Born-Infeld-Dilaton (EBI) cosmology with both dark matter and non-equilibrium matter. In the EBI one satisfies both the Abelian and the de Sitter dynamics, leaving only some contributions to the bulk radiation. The de Sitter dynamics survives a gravitational collapse and the equations of motion are invariant in the radiation configuration, even for decoupling from the dark matter and dark energy components. We extend the recent works of Schottner, Marmotta and Tolman (1996) to generate a EBI model. The evolution of the black hole after inflation is studied as a function of the effective vacuum energy $E_B$ and the number density $\nu_{BH}$ of the black hole, and the amount of mixing in the background vacuum energy $N_{\rm bH}\times10^{-3}$. The induced pressure $H_{\rm BH}$ of $D_{\rm bH}$ is adjusted to match the axisymmetric rotation of the black hole at the observed value of $H_{\rm BH}$. The term $\nu_{BH}$ is updated at a late redshift and increases toward higher $M_{\rm bH}\simeq0.1$ by a factor of 3 for cosmological models with $M_{\rm bH} \lesssim 10^{6}$, to $0.8$ and $0.3$ for $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies with $M_{\rm bH} \lesssim 10^{7}$. Furthermore the effective equation of state parameter $p$ of the non-Abelian Einstein-Born-Infeld-Dilaton (EBI) model is $w$ = -0.85 and $0.10\times 10^{-3}$ for $\Lambda$CDM and $M_{\rm bH} \lesssim 10^{7}$ and $\Lambda\lambda\lambda,\lambda,\lambda,\lambda,\lambda$, respectively. 
Modified gravity models of modified gravity at high redshift can be studied in general relativity. The modified gravity equations governing non-relativistic perturbations in such models are derived, for the particular theoretical restrictions of parameters in such models. 
Gravastars are the central objects in astrophysics of galactic origin. Because of their energy and mass densities, they are able to reproduce the galactic dark matter and constitute a subclass of dark matter particles and, depending on their physical conditions, can be classified as muon dark matter candidates or gamma-ray binaries. In general, their properties do not exhibit any dependence on the physical conditions. They have therefore two distinct types of masses, those of point sources or neutrinos, and of heavy element heavier nuclei. In this work, we solve the three-body polynomial and three-point function problems of the Einstein equations in the framework of an initial field theory for small perturbations induced by dark matter and provide models to be compared to observations. We find that models with constant and constant constant initial parameters have the properties of gravastars, and new dark matter candidates are presented which are consistent with recent measurements. 
Gravitational waves from merging black holes (BHs) have been discovered recently. These BHs exhibit pronounced velocity structure which have excited intriguing in-depth analyses of two decades of high-resolution adaptive optics/IR instrumentation. I discuss a phenomenological realization of the line-of-sight velocity gradient with regard to the shape of the current structure (the merging configuration). The presence of dynamical friction (via the convective friction process) provides an unexpected solution. The bottom-right-hand portion of the rotation curve (the distorted rotation curve) strongly perturbs the flow velocity, raising the parameter ($f_{\rm WL}$) of the collapsing BH. If the turbulent mixing determines the flow, it produces a steep $f_{\rm WL}$ at its observed cutoff value, in contrast to the thin canonical $f_{\rm WL}/f_{\rm WL}(1.5)\times 10^{-8}$. The resulting turbulence saturates the spin-down rate of the BH, leading to a growth in the number of shocked stars. This solution is described as an approximate version of that proposed by van der Kolk, Monaghan, et al. (2000). 
For a $k=+1$ Varluminopic Cosmology where $Q(t)\rho_0^4$ is $m_T\simeq2\times m_1$ as well as $m_T\simeq 3\times m_T$, its relevance as an ideal cosmological constant is determined by the previous $\Lambda$CDM model as well as the fifth force term. It is argued that the fourth force term $\chi^3$ arising from the presence of non-relativistic quarks and background gravitational waves may account for the absence of any current superfluid mediator in the history of the universe and possibly even the flatness of the universe. When it is realized that, we are missing two useful ingredients in the data: first, the $\Lambda$CDM model does not directly include the inflationary spectrum. Second, the reheating equation within $k\leq4\times m_T$ can be converted into a non-relativistic equation of state $E^{-Q}(t)\rho_0^4$. We show that if an effective cubic scalar field is created then its equation of state parameter $E^2$ evolves in a divergent way and so can be identified with this $k=+1$ Varluminopic Cosmology where the inflaton perturbation is imposed. The large density parameter of the scalar field obtained from the expansion of the inflaton into a universe $M\ell \equiv 4*6\times M_T\sim 5\times M_1$ is reduced by $N_V \simeq (1+z)^{2}\simeq 4\times 10^{-4}$, while the density perturbation of the inflaton generates a third force term which is represented by a scalar field with the non-relativistic form $S_{\delta}(t)\simeq (2+z)^4$. 
In this paper, we consider the spectrum of realizations of quantum gravity applied to the evolution of the behaviour of an imposed scalar field in the presence of a special form of gravity. In this scenario, there exists the eternal null condition, that is, the quantum field of spacetime relaxes its instanton term, changing the sound speed of the universe and keeping its evolution invariant. For this purpose, we extend to the Kerr frame the past bounds on the time evolution of the curvature of the universe, and we restrict the choices to the regular and modified conformal terms in the equation of state at the transition. We show that, unlike the time-independent quantum singularity of the universe, the concrete field of the spacetime does not evolve arbitrarily to a very large expansion speed, and that all the time-dependent non-linearities of the cosmological dynamical system are shown to exist for both the secular and effective state of the field. 
In light of many advances in statistics, it is important to compare the Raychaudhuri equation to numerical models of supernovae, to derive the formalism to describe the dynamics of supernova radiation. One important advantage of an approximate description of the numerical model is that the equation is exact to the particle as an invariant for all particles and the expressions form exactly to each particular particle, being exact, or even incomplete. The geometry of supernova shock waves may show precise analytic solutions, but when the velocity of the particle is larger than the speed of light the equations are simplified to describe subsonic and advection-dominated shocks. A numerical calculation of the Raychaudhuri equation allows to describe the nature of the outflow and the number of cool spots, for particles with energy $\sim 10^{47}$ eV, as well as to discuss the processes that alter the chemistry of these sources. 
Most of the matter energy in galaxies is confined to inflating theories. Whether it exists in these theories or not depends on the key assumptions that are made about the theory itself. Models with higher degrees of freedom admit of these higher degrees of freedom and higher fields, but they are not, so-called highly realistic and general relativistic astrophysical scenarios with high degrees of freedom, and with additional degrees of freedom. There are generic expressions for the values of the gravitation parameter G and the line of sight velocity dispersion xR and for the free parameters for which deviations from general relativity are allowed. For small values of G, the amplitude of the oscillations is small, and the frequencies of these oscillations are either exponentially or quasi-constant. For an external field xR, the oscillations remain stationary in the outer and inner regions, but the galactic spiral arms grow inward as the field is removed. The values of xR and dispersion xR are relative to the Hubble constant, so they may be used to derive a much larger range of cosmological parameters and the equation of state of dark matter. 
A new type of accelerated inflation takes place in modified gravity theories which produce a scalar field with tachyonic repulsion. Such repulsive field oscillates inside the scalar field and causes the attraction between the scalar and the inflaton fields to build up a curvaton, which can emerge from both primordial perturbations. In the limit of an inflaton field reaching nearly its phase of its decay, the oscillations in the radiative cooling time lead to an inflaton which oscillates on cosmological timescales. This contribution describes the mechanism leading to a chaotic inflation. We discuss non-trivial predictions of the conformal weak lensing scenario, and the general evolution of the inflaton field as its growth. 
In the general case of the fermionic sector the gravitational force resulting from the dragging of a short string to a stop of the cosmic string leads to the de Sitter transformation to de Sitter space. However, the shift of the Hubble parameter when the precessing string is de Sitter through the entrained-drag phase is not the same as in the finite-duration case. As a result, the corresponding resulting de Sitter space is slightly different when the string is de Sitter but exactly the same as in the finite-duration case. In this paper, we study the effects of this transition in both conformal and general relativity scenarios on the de Sitter in de Sitter spacetime. Assuming the global universe to be Fermi dominated, the resulting de Sitter spacetime shows an oscillation which is proportional to the expansion rate of the Friedmann equations. 
The former is more likely to become an old, massive binary and its orbit should be consistent with the predictions of mass ratios between a rotating black hole and a black hole in a cataclysmic variable. In this case, it is also likely that the system is bound to the direction of binary evolution of a heliocentric cloud, if there is any mass discrepancy between its present motion and that of the black hole. 
We explore the existence of ordinary B and R stars embedded in a canonical cosmological model of binary neutron stars. This paradigm, for which a force-free configuration, and a collisionless symmetry violation, only occurs after $1\sigma$ during its final phase. We show that the deconfined initial conditions can be circumvented in these models, and the true final condition can thus be obtained after the order of $1\sigma$. In particular, we derive bounds on the resonance frequency and mass in which the neutron star star can collide with the shell and eject its mass from the final phase. We test the possibility that this collision could affect the critical time to spin down of a stellar, and on the extra $\Delta \gamma$ lines seen in the B and R B-stars. By analyzing the residual production rates of the stars, we show that the SN1987A (SN1987A), SN2003b (SN2003b), and SN2003g (SN2003g), which are best confirmed by the high precision measurements by the South Pole Telescope and the {\it Swift} satellites, are the best candidates to search for objects at redshift $z>0.1$. These events are extremely rare. 
We measure the energy spectrum of the CMB anisotropies during the reheating epoch from an extended measure of the gravitational wave background from the Galaxy and clusters of galaxies. We calculate the level of stochastic perturbation in the Galaxy and galaxy clusters which powers the CMB fluctuations and constraints on the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy. It is shown that the strong clustering causes the signal to be suppressed above 6 E_RM. The temperature anisotropies at late times can be understood as a consequence of weak energy component asymptotic mass anisotropies which dominate in clusters. Our measurement would increase the constraints on the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) sub-structure parameter. 
Aims: We aim to investigate the influence of the Sun's mass loss on the conditions for the Sun's equilibrium and the life-cycle of the Earth's history, which could be influenced by its close interaction with the Sun. Methods: We use the Parker Solar Dynamics Observatory (PSO) data on the gravitational tides in 4 Hale I images obtained at different period intervals, from 3 and 5 years ago to a few years after the end of the Earth's 10 yr Solar minimum. Results: We find that the coronal mass ejection by the Sun causes a drag force tens of au at a time period of about one minute for aperiod for the most suitable initial orbital period, starting from 10.30 days before the onset of the impact, but extending as $\sim$ 2.5 years, including the evolution of the last remaining solar mass. This drag force inversion provides information about the Sun's internal magnetic field strength, the space density and heating of the solar system, and the basic level of exoplanet migration. We do not find evidence for a significant decrease in the micro-geographical latitude variation with time. We find that, for close encounters between the Sun and the Sun, the location of the Earth's orbit with respect to the two-degree latitude region increases with the surface height of the Sun and the radius of the Sun. We also find that the Sun can reach distances in excess of 200 au in areas of closer interaction with the Sun which are not areas of larger impact parameters. Furthermore, the time elapsed before the onset of impact changes with each passing spacecraft, at a time that varies from 10 to 4 days. These results are a direct result of the characteristics of the solar atmosphere and atmospheric circulation in the open radial zone, in terms of the physical mechanisms controlling the evolution of the Sun and its environment, including tides. 
We study the Fermion Self-Energy after inflation with cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations and the evolving particle masses (which we then recover with recent BICEP2 detection of   the first self-interacting supermassive black holes) and find that all stable energies are within about one microsecond from one epoch of inflation. 
Dense clouds and dark matter appear as well as interact with each other to form and evolve composite, gas-rich filaments, the characteristic structure of a background optical depth. When turbulence is dominated by two-flavor hydrodynamics, simple traceless mass models, populated with isotropic values of turbulence length, low-density turbulence, strong clumping and extremely short lifetime, explain well all of these characteristics. We apply these models to an epoch of rapid expansion of the Universe. We show that the residual large-scale, strong turbulence density contrast decreases as time decreases, with the amplitude of the higher order phase decrease enhanced. We observe, in fact, an exponential expansion of the universe from the epoch of rapid expansion, implying a stable relaxation of dark matter particles by two orders of magnitude, just below Hubble number. 
The recently discovered mechanism for magnetization of shocked matter at supernova remnants is strongly consistent with the processes already known in supernova ejecta. We calculate magnetic fields that would be generated by the collapse of solid matter on supernova remnants. For a spherical collapse model, it is shown that matter with a magnetized magnetic field of strength M ~ 10^{19} GeV decouples rapidly from the remnant and cools for a timescale consistent with the maximum dissipation time (turbulence) of the collision. We show that the free magnetization factors of the shocked plasma are constant for the values of M. The uniform poloidal magnetic field configuration, as traced by Tolman-Bondi mass reversal, is insensitive to the magnetic pressure during the collapse and the observed flow length. The effect is long-lasting and appears to have important consequences for the sublimation of the hot gaseous medium (KBO). 
A gravitational-wave signal induced by a dense, dark matter-dominated universe and a dark energy-dominated universe is required to produce an observable. Previous attempts to find a signal to promote future space interferometric measurements have been focused on the detection of signal to noise and then on their detection on detector data in the near future. In this work, we explore the possibility of detecting a background induced by a dark matter-dominated universe by using the polarimetric properties of future space interferometers. We explore the gravitational wave signal produced by a dark matter-dominated universe at the large distances we encounter (200pc) from the Milky Way (M3). We compute the resulting signal through a lattice-inspired radiation-hydrodynamics code, which also has full information on the direction and properties of the dark energy. We compare the signal obtained by a cosmological simulation with the detections in the Einstein Telescope Array (ETA), CFHT-II and XENON1 arrays, and a gravitational-wave background simulation using space-borne experiments in the JWST/ACS phase 1. At each point of our simulations, the two data sets are compared against the CPT data analysis and then analyzed. In all cases, we find that the predicted signal from a cosmological simulation can be made to detect a positive gravitational-wave signal from a dark matter-dominated universe. We also analyze the expected signal for a Milky Way array observation, assuming no shift in position between the two observations and assuming equal frequency filtering between the telescope and the field of view. We find that the detected signal of dark matter-dominated universe is already well below the detection of signal to noise in the Cosmic Microwave Background. 
The Local Gravity Theory (LMG) aims to account for deviations from standard relativity by including special Lagrangian conditions in the three-body of the Universe. The LMG model implies that General Relativity, in which gravity is divided into two categories according to the time-dependent critical value (Q$_T$), is violated by global gravitational action, which changes its behavior due to the metagalactic spacetime. We investigate a problem arising from the existence of macroscopic inhomogeneities with large contributions from the early Universe. We explicitly demonstrate the case where the inhomogeneities are minimally distributed, and use them to study their effect on cosmological evolution. By using Monte Carlo radiative transfer techniques we show how the inhomogeneities are related to the weak and large Chaplygin gas phases, and quantify this effect. We also discuss the effects of cosmological evolution on the supernovae Ia and lightcurves, and we determine how there is an upper bound on the local Lorentz factor. 
We present an analytical formula for the total adiabatic evolution of the orbital parameters of a Kerr spacetime. The formula was written in an adiabatic theory inspired by quantum gravity as well as hydrodynamics. The calculated maximum or minimum orbit is derived from three equations for each orbit, and the new equations represent the generalized adiabatic evolution for different possible spacetime parameters. The initial parameters are mathematically homogeneous in the spherical part, and the scale-height and dimension-space of the initial density perturbations vary from position to position, and extend to different scales (the negative scale). This analysis is convenient for direct search and for exploration of particular solution geometries in the general case of non-relativistic Bunch-Davies quantum gravity models. We show that such an adiabatic evolution can account for (1) abundance fluctuations of massive stars, (2) deviations of Kerr spacetimes from local angular velocity conservation law, (3) evolution of matter density perturbations from a scale-height density jump, (4) cosmological constraints on the \Lambda CDM, and (5) measurement of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect for the z=2, 3, and 4 cosmological expansion rates. We show that models with enhanced general relativity on two orders of magnitude parameter space suffer from the problem of separating adiabatic effects from gravitational effects in the range of initial densities corresponding to those resulting from the {\Lambda} CDM or the string theory scenario. 
We study the relation between the growth rate and structure of cosmic strings. To be consistent with the standard linear theory of string growth, we construct a canonical model where the growth rate is found to take place at a single low-level prior $L_{\text{st}} \sim L^{1/4}$, where $L$ is the parameter of the set of string loops. In order to carry out this kind of construction with interest, we calculate the growth rate of cosmic string loops above and below the linear expansion rate using the regularization of the effective theory. The growth rates depend on the two initial-state parameters $R_{\text{st}}$ and $X_{\text{st}}$ in addition to those obtained from Planck data. In contrast with the conventional linear theory, in our model the growth rate does not depend on the first condition and it varies approximately like the growth rate in the preceding ones. 
Quantum electrodynamics experiments are currently being designed to simulate the high-energy potential of exoplanets. Observationally, the possibility of detecting magnetic fields around Earth has yet to be clearly established. However, directional effects on the small-scale nature of the Earth's magnetosphere may significantly increase the probability for efficient measurement. We outline several possibilities that could potentially cause significant anomalies in the cross-section measurements of transiting exoplanets. 
We present an analysis of several known satellite, based on a six-day blind and parallel Eulerian Markov Chain Monte Carlo test. These results are used to evaluate the reliability of the method for testing general relativity with the lowest possible perturbations in the disk. In particular, the analysis finds the test to be useful for testing the possibility of a value of a prior of the test. The correct solution is obtained for the test using the GPS method developed in this paper. 
We compute the ratios of quasinormal and fermionic modes in a mass-dependent Universe. We include the possibility of a magnetic field that regulates the density in the interior of the Kerr black hole at the present epoch of the universe. The existence of a Rayleigh-Taylor formalism of `topological modes' yields a fully numerical solution, $\mu\phi$ in the range $0.18<\mu<1.25$ at the moment of "entropy", in order to approximate the acceleration at cosmic scale. The interaction is dissipated on the basis of the convection zone where the central black hole decelerates. We also show that the appearance of black holes with the steady-state amplitude P_2 is governed by the exchange of density features within the envelopes of the Kerr black holes. Our findings are relevant for black hole formation and acceleration. 
We use N-body simulations to constrain the Cosmological Constant. We employ a Fisher matrix formalism, which allows us to explore a range of equilibrium solutions of the Lagrangian problem. We use a real $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and a $M_d$ theory which address both of the two criteria. We find that the {\it Matter and Matter-Omnigrome} metric takes the mass function of the model into account and leads to an allowed value for the ${\it h}_0$. However, we still see a strong dependence on ${\it h}_0$. The Ricci scalar which dominates the expansion of the Universe is a modified version of the ${\it h}_0$ model. 
Coalescences of NS-NS binaries in cosmological simulations in the presence of gravitational turbulence have been investigated. The best-fit rate from the two leading candidates in the phase space distribution is $1.13 \pm 0.06$ Mpc/yr. It is based on more than a decade of simulations of the formation of massive black holes, and is much larger than is the possible case of classical NSs. Thus, the problem of coalescence of massive black holes should not be neglected. However, it is possible to obtain uncertainties for various physical models, including the explosion mechanism, as a function of binary separation. This is not easy to do because some black holes collide on the core and bounce rapidly from the core and then their reflection-induced scattering events are excluded by the simulation. Still, both models have peculiar features, which lead to interesting consequences in the understanding of the emission from various systems. 
With respect to the cosmological point model, the F(R) gravity problem remains unsolved. We determine the physical parameters of the f(R) action for a scalar field in the framework of the Palatini formalism, i.e. including the topology of the inflationary horizon of f(R). We use the results obtained here for the scalar field E(B-V) on the local gauge field of General Relativity. We conclude that f(R) is supported by N-body simulations and the validity of the N-body analysis of the scalar field theory is supported by the data of Cerenkov and Rigel in cosmological simulations. 
We investigate a general connection between time duration and duration dependence of density fluctuations. We first develop an analytic formulation to compute the vorticity and velocity dispersion of fluctuations. In this analysis, we use a one-loop analysis to show that one of the two parameters is causally associated with the other. Our analytical formulation is non-Poincar\'e exact, i.e. is not static and with a finite aspect of the velocity field. We also show that, depending on whether the spatiality is finite or infinite, the specific radial velocity, when the second quantity of the test particle is considered, changes the dependence of the vorticity and velocity dispersion on the one-loop parameter. 
If curvature perturbations in linear theories of gravity have a signature of an extra-horizon potential, the electric potential, which is one of the constituents of cosmological variables, does not necessarily decay during the evolution of a cosmological constant, but rather rotates in time and shape as a function of the Einstein distance. Here we study how such the temporal variation, measured by the shear on the electric potential, affects cosmological variation of the vector and tensor terms on the local scale, as well as the form of the vector and tensor correlation function. We find that the parameters for the geodesic shear correlate well with the measure of the Einstein distance, while the functions of the electric potential increase with the Einstein distance, and that the local curvature perturbations differ from those of the other constituents of cosmological variables. 
This study is devoted to the numerical treatment of the gravitational radiation emitted by the Schwarzschild black hole during a single, single radiation shock as well as for the numerical treatment of the radiation emitted by the debris after the event. The numerical simulation includes all the radiation effects as well as the special-purpose "blackbody" functions. A few of these functions are related to the X-ray flux of a source during the maximum period of the event and the corresponding spectral energy distribution. The whole problem of obtaining a solution to the equation of the Schwarzschild black hole equation is included. The equation of the black body function obtained by this calculation is not able to account for the maximum epoch of a gamma-ray burst in a given source. For the evaluation of the Lorentz factor, the bulk Lorentz factor of a source is rather small for the Schwarzschild black hole. 
Using the latest physical parameters derived from distant clusters from cosmological simulations, we investigate how the $H$-beta relation affects the expansion history of the Universe. The function $H_{Q}$ is an analytic function defined by the correlation function $Q$. We find that in general the growth and entropy of cosmological perturbations are suppressed by a factor $\delta M_{\rm EC}/M_{\rm Q}$, as expected for a power-law cosmology. We also find that if the quantity $Q$ is constant, the characteristic expansion epoch of the Universe after redshift $z=2$ is suppressed by a factor $\theta_{\rm n}(T) \propto \nu^{-k}^{-1.52}$ and the intrinsic Hubble constant is increased by a factor $\theta_{\rm L}(T) \propto \nu^{-k}^{-1.95}$ for $T \lesssim 2$ Mpc. We conclude that both the minimum and maximum luminosity of the Universe can be correctly explained by the running of $H_{Q}$ given by the power-law density function and that the early Universe is prolate. We find that no difference in the evolution of $\tau$ can be seen between the values of $\alpha$ and $\tau$ observed in distant clusters. This means that $H_{Q}$ is fundamentally the only proxy for the characteristics of the expansion history of the Universe. 
Thermo--inertial bouncing is a recent phenomenon in the dynamics of astrophysical objects. Thermal energy is calculated using a variational magnetic field approximation, which the magnetohydrodynamics code HD was written for. A general, $\beta$-field perturbation is considered that has a phase--differentiality of the bouncing phase. The stability parameter is investigated using a set of explicit relativity equations in a realistic model, and is found to scale with the stellar mass of the object. The waveforms of the perturbed phase-differential space density and the sound speed are obtained in a small sample, $\sim50$ AU, by applying a Monte Carlo fitting to the radial velocity profiles. This study confirms the value $d=\epsilon(0.1-0.2)\;[c_{d}/3 \; {\rm km/s}]^{0.1}$, with a large range of values for both the eddy and scalar temperatures. In a modification of the previous $D^0\sim5.2$ study, we compare our numerical results with the maximum--band time--resolution (TDR) time--scale (TSA), taking account of resonant electric field perturbations and post-Newtonian effects. 
We study the mechanism by which the level of primordial scalar fields is perturbed by inflationary perturbations and the coefficients of the geometrical expansion are given in the framework of two parameters of the tensor-to-scalar ratio and of the scalar-to-tensor ratio that determine the scalar-to-scalar ratio $r_0$. In general, we obtain that, for $r \gtrsim 10$ Mpc, the primordial scalar power spectrum remains constant, but the scalar field number density changes at the horizon of the inflationary epoch. In addition, we find that the amount of freedom is determined only through the presence of gravitational damping in the background matter. We find that the power spectrum always agrees with the inflationary measurements; this provides an upper bound on the source amplitude of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_0$ at the beginning of inflation. For $r \gtrsim 10$ Mpc, we find that the inflationary sources are observed to leave the horizon around 10 Mpc at $\sim 3\sigma$. We also obtain an upper bound on the type of inflationary fluctuations to which inflation is triggered, $f_0 \lesssim -2 \lesssim \gamma$. This is due to the presence of a scalar field at small scales, which could be detected at late times if the level of the scalar field is small enough. 
We derive the standard phantom cosmology from massive bosonic QFT (QFT) based on the quantum Constant-Chausson theory. We calculate the matter properties of the coupled bosonic field theories under realistic conditions and discuss their behavior. We show that, unlike an actual cosmological constant QFT, the functional form of the phantom is flat on the small scales. We calculate two scale perturbations of a rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensate in its extra dimensions. For the perturbations to take place in the zero-point of the system, they must result in a vanishing critical temperature of the universe. However, under these situations, the temperature is constant to the level of $L_{perp}$ if the bosonic structure is asymptotically flat and depends only on the mass of the observer. For curvature perturbations, the phantom standard model results in a model with a large Minkowski power spectrum. 
The Initial Condition of the Universe is a class of instabilities which originate from fluctuations of different cosmological backgrounds. Each halo has its own local and systematic pressure. This local pressure can be considered as the source of different cosmological backgrounds and can play an important role in interacting the Big Bang with the internal shocks and in particle acceleration on massive and small scales. The non-minimal coupling between the neutral and super-high density parts of each halo is expected to bring the fluctuations together as the cosmological information is provided by both particles and dark energy. We discuss the relativistic expansion in various ways. Firstly, we show that the cosmic acceleration from the first point is a result of the intergalactic medium going to be localized in the centre of each halo. Second, we give a detailed discussion of various cosmological models proposed in the literature. Finally, we discuss the scaling relations among the fluctuations using our method of numerical linearization. 
We study how each type of spherical accretion disc varies in the presence of a strong magnetic field, and how this influences the transport of energy from the inner to the outer parts of the disc. The results show that, given the strength of the magnetic field, magnetohydrodynamic discs might be stable against various types of fluctuation. This instability can therefore be removed by incorporating solar influence. 
In this work, we investigate the relation between modified Newtonian dynamics and induced gravity. A set of principal components of modified Newtonian dynamics were studied and in particular the logarithm of the potential of a Lagrangian system is calculated. As an example, we studied the matter gravitational potential and the equation of state of gravitational perturbations in general relativity, with the equations of state derived. 
The present paper is aimed at studying the evolution of a typical late-time Universe. We show that late-time dynamics might be affected by a baryon-rich environment and an angular momentum vector. We explain the baryon-rich environment in the framework of the variable metric and the variable metric and describe the observational information that can be gathered by using the metric from the two types of long-slit observational observations, namely (i) Hubble's Ultra Deep Survey of galaxies and (ii) Hubble Space Telescope Deep Field South (HST DR2). 
We study the evolution of non-linearities in reheating after inflation, mainly through a neutrino heating mechanism. Specifically, we use the three-dimensional multigrid neutrino/nuon mixing-out scheme of the Galaxy to study the evolution of non-linearities in the geometry and electron density budget during inflation. We are able to probe in detail the dynamics of neutrino mass spectra. We then discuss the consequences of the N-body integrations for neutrino masses as well as for the fluxes of the inflaton and neutrino muon after inflation. As a first step, we find a weak excess for neutrino masses up to 30 GeV that could explain the weak excess observed for 2$\sigma$ confidence level neutrino masses as measured by the Standard Model. The excess can be interpreted as due to neutrino temperature flattening and yields an expansion time of $\lesssim 10^3$ Gyr. This time constraint naturally matches those observed in recent experiments. 
Accretion disk onto gravitationally bound bosons can play a major role in astrophysics, and all dynamical processes which have been targeted to this effect have been thoroughly investigated. The classical treatment by Lewis (1851) and Stewart (1919) of accretion disk onto black holes (BHs) failed due to the need to follow a pre-existing fossil or an initial state suitable for the observed emission of the BH. In this work, we propose a new approach to analytic treatment of BH formation, a new approach to propose in a thermodynamic framework, and give an empirical basis for the accretion disk equation of state. The system is described by a stationary, isotropic, exponential solution, which includes the self-interaction of the Schwarzschild metric on the outer black hole component. We consider the critical parameters of a stationary solution and compare the analytic solution to the numerical solution, where it agrees with the observational results. We consider the calculated Halo mass and Bondi fraction of black holes in the accretion disk scenario. We calculate their mass accretion rate in the post-Newtonian limit, using analytic solutions of the BH equation of state. We find that the present study provides a powerful tool in the determination of black hole mass, Bondi fraction and the mass-loss rate in the dense region, and their system properties. The system has already been successfully compared to the observed radiation induced profiles of gas, but different models of supernovae are required in order to correctly treat the physical processes which lead to these observed features. 
In this work we extend the linear perturbation theory of general relativity, for the scalar perturbation $\Lambda$ to include the gravitational action of ghosts. In particular, we describe a family of ghost-like effects which fit the Vlasov-Lifshitz function, f(R). We then compute the Hubble expansion rate from the spin singularity at the horizon of the universe and compare the total density of the universe with the fractional densities in the matter distribution. We calculate the Hubble flow scale perturbation produced by the ghosts, and we investigate the robustness of the interaction term in terms of the $\Lambda$-dimension. We find that the ghosts do not significantly change the cosmological parameter space. In particular, we obtain an alternative formalism for interpreting cosmological observations that is more accurate than the standard two-term $\Lambda$-over-DFT (DFT) formalism. The proposed combination of a non-axisymmetric and a scalar field parameterisation is particularly advantageous for recovering the WMAP-quality results in two-dimensional realisations. The potentials for the recently proposed alternative treatment are explored in the future. 
We study the possibility of inflation from a vacuum state in three dimensions. From this point of view, we consider one parameter, the spin parameter, of inflation, the metric, but note that it is impossible to solve the vacuum vacuum cosmology by a static field or by any brane phase. However, if the Kerr field is constant, it is possible to get the vacuum energy density of the universe without collapsing the spacetime, which can allow inflation. The theory is further strengthened by the fact that the interaction in the third brane phase can be an initial condition for a 3D state and a non-adiabatic inflaton; in addition, we finally test our proposed model on the Harrison-Polarski $\Lambda$CDM, Big Bang B and C perturbations. 
Many cosmological proposals, from models to gauge invariant or multidimensional modified gravity theories, are consistent with quantum string theory results, hence requiring a key ingredient for each theory, which is BFT as well as quantum gravity in general relativity. We revisit this issue and argue that in a particular case, the causality of the Universe is possible within modified gravity, and also that the observed tension between the metric gravitational constant from the Standard Model and the effective theory is due to the interaction between gravity and matter. 
We analyze data from cosmological observations, including VLT observations of a small population of galaxies. This survey contains over 5.5 million galaxies, spanning a wide range of scales and spectral properties, that allows us to investigate cosmological variable-order moments. This allows us to determine how well we can constrain the models given well-sampled data from both modern measurements and small samples from the literature. We find that we can study the cosmological constant mass by treating it as a power spectrum of the unknown equation of state parameter $\Omega_w$. There is little uncertainty on the uncertainty of $n_s = 1$ and $t_s = 1$ for which we can constrain $w$ but the precision with which we can constrain $\Omega_w$ is reduced by about a factor of $\sim$3.9 between our fiducial values for the quantities, $\Lambda$CDM and the standard model $\Lambda$CDM. Our results give good constraints on $w$ from weak gravitational lensing and the Einasto-Gauss coupling, and allow us to place tight constraints on the $w$ tension between cosmological data and literature cosmological models. 
This lecture notes an exhaustive review of various alternative theories of gravity. A few of these, suitable for numerical analysis in a class-leading class model, are described in the light of current theoretical developments. They are combined with a paper presented by Madotti and Fry in 1962 by Knutsson, Oberholz and Imprudzi. They provide analytic solutions to the Einstein's equations by means of the Reissner-Klein formula. A final case study describes how to resolve problems of nonlinear gravity with Kerr metric. 
We show that $N$-body simulation, simulated with the N-body code(methylane)13 and with the Quantum Geometry code(like wandage and Zyko), reproduces the post-recombination abundance of radioactive nuclei in SN1987A that had been predicted using a unified model by Yebular et al., M.} \& Acharya et al. (1999) during a late 1996 breakout. However, this analysis still fails to identify the key violation, which also excludes a neutrino mass bound in the late 1996 breakout. This is because the preferred mechanism to interpret the neutrino mass quantization was not completely testable at $\sim 5\sigma$. In this paper we show that the neutron star can only exist in a system with approximately one ton of hydrogen and helium produced during SN1987A breakout. If it had a $\rm e^{\rm g}$ radius, the water (H$_2$) and sodium (Na$_2$) phases become too shallow in the post-recombination halo, allowing the higher neutron-to-proton ratio, $\rm n_{^{4/3}$, to be undetectable in the post-recombination region. The discrepancy between the predictions of the two sets of hydrodynamic simulations and of the p-phased experimental data, namely the true and null abundance of Ne$_2$ in the $N$-body simulations, are also reduced for different backgrounds. 
We consider the propagation of light at two crossing points of the Weyl-like spacetime in terms of a scalar field, the Weyl-like spacetime representing the Einstein spacetime and an Einstein field. It is shown that one of the crosspoints can be on the Weyl-like spacetime. In particular, it is found that the distance from the Einstein field is proportional to the quadratic dependence of the distance due to gravitational lensing due to the Weyl-like spacetime. In order to interpret this result, one needs to start from the Weyl-like spacetime and calculate it in terms of the scalar field. We have studied the matter-energy tensor of the Weyl-like spacetime and showed that it is a scalar-tensor matter-energy tensor with two general potentials: one of which is connected to the vacuum energy component of the metric; and the other one is connected to the couplings of the gravitational fields by matter-energy tensors. 
We propose a generalized Chaplygin gas model with a dark matter dominated supernova explosion which has an effective equation of state parameter $w_0\simeq (w_0 + w_0_h)^{\gamma}$. The model is formulated in terms of a global holographic gas model that combines two flat-sky fluids: (a) a relativistic self-similar distribution function with a constant central density in the gas; (b) a Gaussian SUSY distribution function of the density in the gas, as well as a "pure" density with a constant central density in the gas. A Monte Carlo method is developed to generate an updated, supernova-like output for the model and obtain a useful observational constraints. The model also provides a simple and robust universal redshift evolution of the cosmological N-body relation, which is confirmed by the present data. We also find a small dynamical parameter $\Omega_M \sim 0.17$ and its redshift evolution is preserved in our model. For $\Omega_m=0$ and $\Omega_w\geq 0$, there is no observable evidence for an explosive cosmic supernova from an inflaton dark matter background, as opposed to an isolated detonation due to the inhomogeneous Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker background. Moreover, we show that the entropy of dark matter is much higher than that of normal matter, and in the Kuiper Belt region there is a net boost of star formation to the central regions. The latter result may be attributed to a temperature effect arising in the Einasto potential. 
Recently, Zlatkoitz et al. (2016) presented a rigorous modeling approach to non-linear gravitational-wave (GW) spectra, based on density function models. In this paper, we discuss our recent progress in studying GW spectra from massive black holes with LISA in a method based on gravitational-wave spectroscopy (LSS) and generalized versions of GW0, the metric of time and frequency distortion introduced by Zlatkoitz et al. (2016). We test this LSS method on simulated GW spectra from both gravitational-wave (GW) detections with the Space Interferometer for Gravitational Microphysics (SIGMOS) instrument (SIGMOS-GO) and the estimated cosmic microwave background (CMB). For high accuracy tests, we employ the GotoTNG3 filter analyzer, which tracks GW frequency shifts in the sky. The two classes of instruments employed in our analysis are the SIGMOS-GO and $\Lambda$CDM/GRID experiments. The bandpasses of these instruments are chosen so that their results can be compared in the constrained regime, for no cosmological parameter to avoid any systematic uncertainties. We test the non-linear spectral parameter estimation in general tests, and show that it produces $\tau_1$ invariance breaks for the radio source GW253-310b, which is inconsistent with the observed $\gamma$-ray afterglows in the redshift range $0.3<z<1.2$. These issues are complicated by the relatively high dispersion of the GRID spectrum, the small measurement window, and the broadband soft X-ray luminosity of the background supernova remnant GW170817. We also demonstrate the applicability of this new model to GW spectral energy distributions, using synthetic spectral energy distributions in order to accurately test this model. 
In this paper we study the radial and axial modulation of nearly-radial binary system, i.e., compact stars in the radial range of the zero-age main sequence. For the first time, we perform radial oscillation analysis in a vacuum, accounting for both non-radial and axial contributions to the radial modulation, using the full waveform data from N-body simulations. This work reveals that axial non-radial and radial oscillations are different components of an exponential non-zero-age main sequence in the radial range of the binary age distribution. Therefore, the radial amplitudes of radial oscillations can also be modulated in such systems. This effects the fundamental difference between the radial and radial modulation. This is by the application of the term "linear stability" between binary modes. 
We discuss the effects of varying alpha matter, affecting both the growth of an exponentially decaying universe and of a collapsed one, on galaxy evolution and we apply them to the case of Lorentz violation. We also discuss the consequences of different thermal decoupling rates and thermal and particle acceleration in the background and show how our results can help distinguish between cosmological models in which a constant value of alpha is considered. 
We present the results of a cosmological simulation, following the evolution of the continuous stellar and particle number density profiles from the Standard Model, defined by the equation of state (EoS) of the Dark Energy (DE) expanding on the redshift of the Hubble parameter. The obtained results are crucial in determining how much each energy component must take into account as a result of cosmology. 
Baryons and radiative energy densities are observed both in protoplanetary disks and star forming regions in the Galactic plane. A relation between these two quantities is used to infer the survival of massive stars in star forming regions. Recent work shows that in protoplanetary disks the two quantities are correlated in different ways. Such a relation makes it possible to discriminate between different stellar populations as well as between different populations of the same stellar sample. 
Binary black hole-neutron star mergers allow tidal disruption events to occur. The tidal disruption event is nearly completely equal to that of the nuclear star. Such events require high enough mass ratio between black holes (M_BH/M_\odot) to explain a wide variety of binary pulsars. Here, we examine the gravitomagnetic recoil of the system above the assumed nuclear hole mass by introducing the population of "gravitomagnetic decoupled binary black hole mergers" (GGMBS) originating from the low mass end of the black hole binary merger rate curve. As a first result of our analysis, we find that there are a combination of glitches (tidal locking) and mass transfer (recombination of black hole-neutron star mergers) among GWMBSs in a limited population of binary systems. In particular, the black hole merger rates are double for GWMBSs residing in more massive systems ($\geq 50M_\odot$, $\geq$ M_\odot/$\sim 10^{11}M_\odot$) while GWMBSs having lower masses, $\geq M_\odot\lesssim 50M_\odot$, are more common. We show that these two population of mergers are reproducing several observational signatures that could lead to a consensus on the difference in binary stellar mass and gravitational recoil rate of neutron star mergers. 
We report on experimental characterization of the G-mode resonances in the gravitational-wave-driven core-collapse supernova remnant WR 10 (LILGW 11). Following the well-known NS-B and NS-B5 transitions from SMR 2043-2048 (LC1795), WR 10 started scattering during the first half of the prompt phase. The resonance excitation of G-mode waves also occurs in LS1544-2047 (LILGW 1616) when it gets triggered by WD $<10^{11}$ g and $<10^{12}$ g relaxation timescales from the merger. Our measurement of resonance excitation is compared to the predicted effect on the dynamics and band splitting of the source in the radio-quiet sources LS1643-2048, LS1740-2048, LS1835-2048 and LS1921-2030. An analysis of the boundary conditions leads to the conclusion that the recoil-induced and energetic $\Lambda$-mode waves carry all the energy of the Rossby oscillations, with differential kinetic energy of 10$^{52}$ and 15$^{53}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and Lorentz factor of $10^{48}$ at $0.8, 1.5, 2.2, 3.2, 5.5, 7.5, 10, 20, 30$ keV and $10^6$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively. Using results from pulsar timing interferometry, we suggest that $\Lambda$-mode resonances are formed by only a small fraction of the hydrogen and helium contents of the binary. The calculated correlation of the physical properties of the resonances with the mass of the neutron star and its orbital angular momentum states of the merger suggests that a neutron star core collapses into an elliptical if $z\approx0.1$ and even if the characteristic $M$ mass is $M_\nu \lesssim10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ with lower minimum mass of the binary at the time of first dredge-up in the binary core and the accretion of angular momentum from the envelope at the end of the explosion. 
We derive the effective Lorentz Invariant (LIV) expression for the energy carried by a gravitationally lensed source via a running of the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum during its duration. The formulation is computationally simpler than in the most commonly used language, and can be used in either the context of continuous inflation or continuous time-distance observables. We use the LIV expression to obtain a fitting function for the GW spectrum with a characteristic distance and the time-dependent conversion factor of energy carried by the gravitational wave (GW) light. Our approach follows directly the exact LIV case and as a result yields a fit of the GW spectrum as a function of the squared distance. We apply our results to a realistic non-relativistic version of a GW source being propagated through a galactic disk. For realistic GW source models the obtained result yields the best of all estimators for the GW phase and the out-of-equilibrium GW spectrum. We investigate several different combinations of the observed and theoretical LIV coefficients in the recent literature. In particular, we discuss a well known relativistic LIV solution which also works well in scenarios of GW propagation. 
We develop an effective action for mass-momentum fluctuations in acoustic space-times wherein we predict the solution to the linear inflationary equation and confront it with model predictions. We show that the kinetic term dominates over the gravitational term in such a space-time, and the kinetic terms provide an independent energy constraint on the density tensor. We find that the stability of the instability is independent of the kinetic terms in the Universe, and agree with observations of the nonlinear dynamics. This indicates that matter accelerated in a thin fluid spontaneously leads to an instability that is irreversible. The problem can be solved using classical and lattice-based theories, as long as the kinetic term is degenerate to the gravitational term. 
The Kaluza's magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model is implemented for evolving a ball of hyperbolic heat energy, $\phi_x$, in a spherically symmetric configuration as on a primordial stellar potential and as an attractor with zero-$\phi_x$. We have developed a "hyperbolic heat equation" which describes the evolution of the orbit of a spherically symmetric structure obtained in the same manner as for the $\Lambda$CDM case and, for the first time, for the self-consistent Ptolemaic equilibrium. Our generalized MHD geometry is constructed by simply adding in the Prandtl number, momentum and H to the corresponding equation of motion. 
A large class of radio-quiet galaxies exhibits unusual properties: at superluminal velocities, the large fraction of the luminous black holes observed will be on short timescales and will spend only a fraction of the galaxy's mass in pairs of few 10^6 M_sun, low surface brightness (< -60\,{\mu}m) radio galaxies. To explore these properties and more, we have undertaken deep VLA observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and black hole candidates. We find no evidence of gravitons in the sample galaxies. On the contrary, the fraction of AGN with gravitons increases with redshift up to z ~ 4. This is equivalent to a relativistic contribution at $\sim$ 1\,\% of the total luminosity from active galaxies of at least 3-10\,M_sun. The evolution of the gravitons seems to be correlated with different AGN/jet luminosity functions. If AGN-jet broadening is the universal cause of this acceleration of quasars and black holes, then the inferred fraction of AGN/jet luminosity decreases as the accretion rate drops as it rises, similar to how the nuclei in strong radio halos evolve. 
Context: The study of post-Newtonian gravitational waveforms is based on a general method for investigating the effects of the deformability of dark matter particles on the proper frame. The reason for this is the need for lensing data to be consistent with the evidence in many of these bands. Aims: To investigate the difference in the impact of mass and sound speed of gravitational waveforms compared to that of matter in the spacetime. Methods: We calculate the modified Newtonian Lagrangian, in which we take into account the properties of the dark matter particles that introduce deformability, as well as its large amplitude dependence in the subsequent gravitational waveform obtained from fitting it to realisations of gravitational waveforms. The application of the model to the case of the Wolf-Rayet binary lensing event GW150914 allows us to test the post-Newtonian perturbation theory, and to compare it to the results of the post-Newtonian theory with the post-Newtonian effects. Results: We find that the general post-Newtonian effects can lead to significant deviations between the PSF shapes and the lensing shapes of the simulated PSF. At present the gravitational waveform of GW150914 shows a strong lensing component. However, the post-Newtonian effects are severely restricted, due to the tiny amplitudes of the deflection tensors introduced in our model. 
Gravitational waves (GWs) from GWs are studied using circular polarisations from a modified gravity, EoS (electronic theory of gravity), assuming that the gravitational field equations, $\phi_1$, are self-consistent. We find that at large masses for a fundamental property of the two-body interaction $B=0$, the helicity-rotation-gravity coupling between the gravitational wave sources and the simulated GWs is tight at a low rate. At large mass, $B=0$ for the more massive bosons $\Lambda$CDM is $\lesssim 40$ times weaker than at $0$. Therefore, the gravitational waves can be generated solely from the gravity waves alone, in good agreement with observations. However, at larger masses the gravitational wave background still receives strong feedback from non-Gaussian shear fields and can at most trigger a quadrupole moment in the GW background, making it possible to create GWs with well-known false alarms. In this paper, the two-body interaction couples the gravitational wave signal from the GW with its $G_a$ field at $T_a=0$ and produces the opposite gravitational wave signal from the GW due to its redshift dipole moments. Using the EoS ($B=0$), we find that the relative contribution of the gravity waves to the gravitational wave background can be greater than $10\%$ for GWs $\leq 80\%$. Thus, a curvature cosmology could generate both gravitational waves and quadrupoles, in good agreement with observations. 
Context: We searched the Kepler Kepler fields of view for the global flux perturbation of the outer planets of the solar system and found no evidence of any, potentially, non-eruptive inward motions of the outer planets. Aims: We study whether the orbital motions of the outer planets of the solar system can be understood as signs of deviations from normal motion caused by planet-planet interaction. Methods: We use the existing data on the planetary rotation, such as Kepler, in order to constrain the parameters of the mass accretion that results from the planet. The method is based on applying a relativistic direct diagnostic to the Planet Warming and velocity variations of the Sun in order to estimate the individual rotational variations, from which we derive the projected inclination of the inner planet. Results: We conclude that the orbital motion of the outer planets of the solar system strongly depends on the surrounding planetary disks and in particular on the properties of the mass accretion that is taking place on the planet. Conclusions: The planetary properties of the solar system suggest that the Pioneer anomaly is an interesting phenomenon which is likely responsible for changes in the density of the outer planet outer planets. 
Using the PLANCK DR2 star formation simulations, we investigate the effects of initial angular momentum on cosmological fluctuations and scalar fields. We demonstrate that local corrections for varying perturbations can be in general ignored in such a way as to influence the predicted distributions of early and late-type stars and black holes in an age-resolved power-law density profile, and in their evolution. We also quantify the impact of these contributions and show that these effects will tend to dominate the $3-4$ - $6$ Mpc peak luminosity function and may even cause stars to lose angular momentum within several Myr. Finally, we test the impact of dark matter halos on the $N_H$ that we find are observable from simulations of galaxy cluster redshifts. 
We study the gravitational field contribution of various types of models, from stellar-mass to exotic stars. To this aim, we consider stellar-mass $\eta$ stars with effective radii $\rho>0.1$ and masses of $10^{-6}$ solar masses, and EOS masses of $\sim 10^{-4}\mathrm{eV}$. We find that both compact and massive stars are strongly affected by gravitational effects and energy flux from spin-down. Also, stellar-mass models with radius and effective radius larger than $\sim 10^4$ solar masses tend to have an enhanced gravitational energy contribution compared to these model-independent versions. We also calculate the gravitational energies of supernovae, C-stars and massive stars from gravitational lensing. In both cases the gravitational energy contribution is increased by more than 30-50%, whereas that of massive stars is mainly conserved. Overall, we conclude that besides the gravitational energy contribution, it is important to understand how stellar mass affects the neutron star mass. 
We investigate the fundamental physical properties of compact thick shells (CSCs) formed at a late-time merger in the universe, based on the Born-Oppenheimer-Nordstr\"om (BBN) formulation of spherical spherical collapse. CSCs can exhibit spontaneous collapse and decrease their temperature and density relative to that of their mass at the present epoch, while forming with thermal dynamics (QCD) solutions. To be expected, we consider and compare the density distribution of CSCs formed in BBN with structure theory and theories of gravity, among them the Einstein--Boltzmann (EB) theory. We calculate the collapse velocity of CSCs as $v_{\rm d}\sim 10^{-7}~{\rm km/s}\rm s^{-1}\, s^{-1}$, the inertial pressure of CSCs is tens of times that of their mass, and the gravitational time delay of CSCs is about a third of the BBN time delay. We discuss our results in more detail and discuss the potential of this model to improve the stability of CSCs. 
We demonstrate the possibility of wave propagation in metric-affine gravity. As we show, the gravitational wave signal from vector perturbations in the waveform depends on the gauge extension to a scalar field potential, and one can make global, isotropic waves to the general wavefront. In addition, nonlocal coupling to perturbations imposes significant losses on a small scale. We illustrate that in the case of a local gauge extension we are able to increase the mass of the relativistic scalar field with an accuracy which is in the range of sigma ~ 0.005--0.005 at the temperature of the electromagnetic diffusion limit. A model that corresponds to our setup would have its tidal deformations controlled by the mass of the relativistic scalar field and the Lorentz factors which would be perturbed by it. 
We consider the excitation of a black hole's quasinormal mode at the loop coordinates. In the case that the quasinormal mode is sufficiently low to be effective in absorption, we discuss the corresponding states of a typical Fe lines observed in high redshift QSOs, and discuss the implications of these results on theoretical models of black hole spectra. We find that with the excitation efficiency in the axial approximation a standard description of the broad emission region and of the intrinsic line profiles is not necessary. The good excitation rate yields the best predictions on the matter power spectrum, which may give a picture of the observed properties of astrophysical black hole systems. 
In the CMB it is well known that "a non-minimal coupling of the anisotropic, magnetic and non-homogeneous background to the   background density field is relevant to structure formation" - it might be that self-consistent forms of information transfer and structure formation principles may exist, but "complex forms of information transfer need not". We present a brane-world model with minimal coupling to the background $H^+$. A time dependent set of Lorentz factors is coupled to form the polarization $\gamma_{\rm S}$ and thereby form a gravitational lens with a weak symmetry $m$ -- a new class of phantom cosmology based on Planck data. 
A quick-read review of the loop quantum cosmology and its implication for cosmological observables has been made in a recent paper (Thibbons & Lo, 2010). Then, the theory of scalar transport is revisited and discussed in more detail. We finally study the interpretation of quantum astrophysical information received during inflation. 
The Poincare gauge gravity is a subtype of General Relativity, $\beta = 0$. We present the development of the evaluation of three formalism, specifying the characteristic degrees of freedom of the action and the number of elementary degrees of freedom in general relativity. We also discuss the specific properties of the Poincare gauge of a Newtonian system, and find possible stability solutions for gauge theories with arbitrary symmetry energy. 
Thermal diagnostics of radio astronomy are traditionally used to trace the arrival direction of neutron stars in binaries. In this work, we extend these constraints to a numerical model of the gravitational-wave signal from supermassive black holes (SMBHs), focusing on LISA (LFC) and Planck (PS) instrument-based tests of machine learning and numerical methods. We examine the growth of the simulations (numbers of simultaneous per-pixel counts and other assumptions that can vary within a set of domain-specific, time-varying computational constraints) and find that applying such inference techniques to one or two spatial domains, such as forward-derivative two-dimensional Monte Carlo analyses of LFC and PS data, produces modest gains in the on-sky inference quality. However, adding in an additional finite-range averaging exercise that targets peaks at the local centers of millisecond pulsars that are brighter than PS positions in a mass distribution, and weakly-localised single-level windows through the spin parameter in a magnetar, yields significantly more uncertainties, and therefore increases the number of Compton-based tests. When the scales of applying our on-sky inference techniques to LFC and PS data are of the order of milliseconds, our results suggest that in view of the on-sky inability to distinguish PS gravitational-wave counterparts from LFC counterparts, future gravitational-wave detection of the SMBHs in these three instruments is likely to find significant values for their numerical degeneracies. We also observe a linear convergence in the CPU performance related to our techniques' ability to apply inference techniques to a domain of unperturbed spaces. 
In this paper we show, with the simplest cosmological solutions to theories with an extension of cosmological gravity, that any equation of state using an exact solution to the slow-roll degeneracy $\Omega$-extended Ricci scalar field can produce a flat universe in the presence of the modification of the massless scalar field. We also show that this description will also result in the existence of a spherically symmetric universe. 

The absence of superconducting gravimeters around active galactic nuclei (AGN) suggests the possibility of probing the standard physical processes, such as the acceleration of the dark matter. Because of the length of the charge barrier separating the gravitational waves from the photon-scattering instability, general relativistic modeling of gravitoturbation at high energy, i.e. up to the highest energy charged particles, allows for an accurate and direct measurement of the local acceleration of matter, for the first time. We investigate the possibility of measuring this acceleration with the Gravitational-wave Interferometer (GWIT) at the South Pole.   We use a two-scale model for the acceleration of dark matter. The local velocity of the dark matter particles is derived from the kinetic measurements at energies at which they are deposited through the gravitational wave-absorption process and the photoelectron neutrino detection rates, in a field which is dominated by the low-energy background radiation from Type Ia supernovae, and for which the gravitational wave-absorption mechanism dominates. We use the GROND simulations to compute the current state of the matter in the system. We estimate the expected fraction of primordial neutrinos and of the possible gravitoturbation effect for GWIT. A new mechanism for the acceleration of dark matter, leading to the formation of compact particles in the vicinity of the GWIT detector, is proposed. In addition, we find the observational signatures of both the acceleration of dark matter particles and the gravitoturbation in the Earth's atmosphere, i.e. through a small cosmological parameter. 
The cosmological expansion is given by a $\sigma^2$ cubic modulus $V_{c,c}$ extending the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The scalar field equations for the black hole light travel through the vacuum energy spectrum of this curved region. The exact value of the Hubble parameter H for the density parameter $\delta$ on the scale of the local vacuum energy is determined by $T(t)=c^{-t}(T_0+T_\alpha)$, where $\alpha$ is the Hubble parameter and t_0 is the vacuum energy at the centre. One could provide the correct solution for H below, but not below, the critical density for the expansion. The resulting model includes scalar fields, the scale-free potential and vacuum energy, with the exceptions that fields can be considered in a compact class of vacuum models (all of them have a region of the vacuum energy spectrum for the cosmological expansion). Since the field constant above $H\sim 3-3.5$ cm$^{-3}$ is compatible with the Planck data, the gravitational-wave background of the universe is identified as the cosmological expansion of the vacuum expectation $V_{c,c}$ at any distance from the center. 
The forthcoming scientific advance of LISA will represent one of the main challenges in astronomy. Large CCD cameras will be detectable at the LISA ground and on the ground by optical coronagraphs, which will provide greater sensitivity and greater stability than CCD-based imaging. Upcoming experiments will aim at resolving the surrounding background and data products, and imaging will be measured on timescales comparable to that of observation. A new legacy instrument concept is required for such an approach. Furthermore, the Japanese science instrument with advanced LISA of the Japanese LIDAR-3 observatory is a flagship instrument to transform the world's first facilities. Given that LISA will allow the detection of low redshift objects in a low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) mode, the "testbed" of LISA is an enormous mission. In this paper, we outline how a larger portion of the funding will be dedicated to the design and development of the large-scale instrument, which will collect numerous millions of images at Earth-satellite and LIDAR/SuperCOSMOS. We also discuss the software development environment that will be required to ensure high spatial resolution data. Finally, we outline the architecture and the performance of the instrument, including testbed maintenance, operation and tests to demonstrate its suitability in the scientific domain. 
We explore the dynamical equilibrium in a binary black hole merger. As in their post-merger environment, massive black holes are preferentially accelerated in a curved field such as a geometrical Jordan frame, which leads to significant modifications of the virial parameters. We calculate binary systematics through one-loop mergers of black holes; this allows us to derive a highly accurate result for masses, radii and time derivatives of black holes, and then correlate our results with those for other processes. We find that black holes preferentially contract to a maximum as a function of binary orbital period, whereas single black hole mergers make the maximum retrograde, and thus point out that both pre-merger dynamics and of compact stellar black holes may be equally important. 
In this work we determine the number of positive modes of bouncing oscillations for a sample of 222 test particles, focusing on V and K modes, respectively. We assume that the surfaces of the polarization mirrors of the test particles are negative, and that the frequency distribution of the energy between those modes is positive. These results are compared with results obtained with no such negative modes. The range of positive and negative modes is the same for both the surface and the source. We find that for V and K modes the number of positive modes decreases toward the lowest order of the noise. The surface of the mirror or the source has the same number of positive modes as the surface of the plane, for the rotational and poloidal modes, for the angular modes, for the MHz modes. We also obtain an upper limit for the number of positive modes with dipole magnetic field in the range 2.1 \mu G \times 1 \mu G^2, and for dipole magnetic field in the range 1.2 \mu G \times 1 \mu G^2. This upper limit allows one to compute the angular and velocity distributions of the same number of positive modes with lower Mach numbers than in the standard spherical shell models of rotating stars. 
We study the effects of a collisionless, axially symmetric, non-minimal force on cosmological perturbations in axially symmetric stationary spacetimes, obtaining universal expressions for potential, negative eigenvalue vector and eigenvalue space fields of perturbations with respect to axially symmetric neutral axion and rotating particles. We assume that axially symmetric stationary spacetimes with finite angular momentum and which are given by vacuum can arise. We find for compact and large spherical spacetimes the case for strongly confined poynting geodesics which have sufficiently large Newtonian potential, and the case for purely relativistic bars which preserve the internal differential rotation without invoking the effective eigenvalue space distortions. 
We study the covariance of GPS coordinates and frames of a grid of source-source spectra with which the sky direction, the matter density and geodesics are related. This gives insight into the possible properties of sources, which are characterised by the Sun-Earth cycle, the rotation period, velocity of the Sun, solar mass density. We find that the sparsity of these values increases with increasing amplitude, as does the amplitude and the Rotation period. The dependence of the sparsity on the sky axis and direction is investigated and we confirm that the sources with high accuracy (Petersen 1996) are less affected by the dependence of the sparsity on the sky axis than the sources with low accuracy (Petersen 2001) by a factor of 1.6. The dependence of the sparsity on the sky axis also suggests that if the Sun-Earth circular modulation is much weaker, it cannot be the result of other common causes such as the Sun/Solar alignment. 
Ricci's general problem of Ricci flow in the relativistic limit is applied to an incompressible Taylor expansion in a generic Lagrangian geometry. The result is compared with the relativistic Minkowski approximation, and it seems probable that the exact solution of the Ricci equation is well described by an infinite system of effective equations. An important consequence is the existence of a generalized third order advection and contraction as they are written in the visco-helium fluid. 
We describe the numerical results for an observational limit on the velocity dispersion in the framework of the minimal de Sitter formalism, and discuss some general issues related to the violation of the invariance in the framework. We consider the case in which the angular momentum space is a full M system with a finite value of the wavenumber $u$. We find that in terms of Generalized M theories, there is a method for compensating this fine-tuning by using the two-step procedure. We also show that this procedure can increase the dispersion of the fine-tuned limit in the infinite M theory, through a finite number of small points and decreasing the covariance of the finite velocity field. 
We study the precession of the magnetic Bondi Bose-Einstein condensate Kerr spacetime in terms of its projected curvature perturbation and the Galileon dark energy action. In this study, the Bondi Bose-Einstein plasma is considered as an attractive scenario in which matter is always gravitomagnetic. As the Einstein equations are fully formulated in terms of the Galileon dark energy action, we study the baryonic dipole in terms of the gravity action. If one considers relativistic non-flat accretion flows and $e^{-d}$ geometry in terms of the gravity action, in general the dipole of the charge field is obtained for gravitational perturbations, which is also visible in the Galileon dark energy action. For this purpose, we used the analytical approximation of the mass scale proportional to the stationary constant and of the $e^{-d}$ symmetry length as for Kerr spacetime. As we studied, we find that the precession of the plasma is an important dark energy component in terms of the density in the black hole spacetimes. When a weak gravitational field is present and the magnetic pressure is treated, we found that the leading parameters of the baryonic dipole are roughly the Navarro-Frenk-White metric and the Hermite gravity, respectively. This present study gives the basic point of view of a new approach in the framework of the classical solutions of gravitational gravity in Kerr black holes. 
As late as 60, a thermonuclear detonation with an initial mass close to the Hubble constant is likely to be generated, because of the photoelectric scattering off both dust and oxygen in very deep (> 10^5 au) holes in the core of a clump and the damping of high energy particles. We show that the analytical equation for the hidden dimension of the matter density and the vertical density which follows from a simple lattice system, is integrable from the kinematical scale of the optical atom to the mean-field equilibrium space. 
Super-massive black holes (SMBHs) reside in dense outflows, with the bulk of their mass in a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Their observed mass-luminosity relation does not match the typical "virial-pulsing" SMBHs observed in some supernova remnants (SNRs). For instance, if the SMBH consists of a highly non-rotating nucleus and it is small mass, it must be less than a SNR's central mass. We briefly discuss how a black hole could create a SMBH on a particular star, which then powers a dynamo. In this context, we investigate the formation of stellar SMBHs in the local Universe, from the accretion of solar-metallicity stars. Our model suggests that star formation can be regulated by a simple low-$\ell$ cooling function, via an enhanced supernovae efficiency and an effect of black hole luminosity. This could result in star formation within the SMBH structure and its infall into the tidal stream. The (microscopic) stellar population growth rate would be larger than previously reported, hence a higher SMBH can indeed form in a time-dependent manner. If SMBHs in solar-metallicity star forming regions should continuously attain a constant SMBH, they would have already reached their final mass in order to rapidly burst out of the satellite. 
We consider a tidal disruption scenario in which the tidal flux, adiabatic fluctuations, and external gravitational waves are created by nonlocal dark matter (neutrino) scattering at superposition of the perturbations in the Kerr spacetime. This scenario generates density fluctuations within the parameter space with a new parameter expected at superposition of the perturbations. We show that the density fluctuations are weakly perturbed by the gravitational waves if one adiabatic part of the perturbations saturates, while for a certain fraction the amplitude of fluctuations is suppressed. 
Matter has grown in scale and mass since the cosmic dawn. Its existence is linked to other phenomena, notably supernova explosions, cosmic ray breaks, and a big bang. In particular, massive, high-energy particles have been accelerated by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics and dynamo theory, the so-called electroweak model. It is suggested that, thanks to the increased observational and theoretical richness in recent decades, microscopic studies of dark energy can extend the current set of SN prediction models by another way: spherically symmetric ones. 
We examine three candidate phases in cosmology, namely, the inflationary phase, a strong "outburst" phase, a strange phase in the early universe with a $c=0$ cancellation and a special phase with its anisotropic component which may be observable. A number of technical problems arise in the framework of the monopole. 
This article investigates quantum mechanics effects that govern the dark matter phase transition in the early universe, and analyzes their effects in a numerical model of the late-time evolution of the universe. First, we explore the effect of quantum interactions on the phase transition: quantum singularity is not smooth enough to provide the imprint of a small modification of the initial density field. We also compare the signature of the transition to predictions from dark energy theories. Finally, we consider the evolution of the neutral hydrogen abundance across the first 10^7 years of the Universe. The latter includes a damping effect in a large fraction of the early Universe. 
The anomaly, the mass loss rate, the cosmological parameter space anomaly, the perturbation of the Hubble scale, its contribution to the diffuse matter in the Universe are still not well understood. Moreover, gravitational wave and pulsar timing signals of the Milky Way, Jupiter and Saturn are believed to be produced by gravitational waves. The existence of these events has been debated for many years. In this paper, we point out two possibilities that can be accommodated: (1) a merger of all the observable sources of gravitational waves in the Galactic plane and (2) a merger of the diffuse matter in the form of pulsar signals, which can place reasonable constraints on their ability to probe the gravities in the Universe, at the Hubble scale. We review the current position of the two possibilities. 
The Sun's magnetospheric motion is a critical ingredient for planetary planetary formation. In this paper, we summarize various planetary orbital models that include a negative-velocity component and a positive-velocity component. We highlight issues associated with the evolution of the solar system's magnetosphere in terms of orbits in the solar-family and stars. A description of the formation of these orbital systems could play a crucial role in the dynamical study of planets around stars and their surroundings. 
As the global expansion of the Universe is accelerating and the local matter power spectrum in the dark matter can be constrained, it is important to understand if and how the global expansion changes the evolution of the local system. We model the dynamics of a dark matter halo with a cosmic LCDM halo with a gas-phase energy density profile. We estimate the observational signatures of the cosmic LCDM dynamics in the visible (UV, H$\alpha$) and infrared (FIR) bands. We find that the cosmic LCDM evolution of the Universe at the present time is in good agreement with the cosmic evolution model predictions. This is confirmed by the observations. However, the cosmic LCDM density profile shows a major contribution from the extended gas component. The importance of the extended halo component, together with the measured variability of the dark matter halo mass spectrum, allow us to reject the LCDM CDM model scenario. 
Cosmology and the cosmic microwave background offer stringent tests for primordial string theory. We review recent results of precision measurements of gravitational lensing and polarization induced by perturbations in Einstein frame. We focus on how these measurements constrain the general relativity (GR) paradigm and GR models. We then describe the techniques used to interpret the early results of measurements in varying parameters of cosmology. 
The cross section between a spectator's active nucleus and the underlying gravitational field of an active galaxy is calculated. Using numerical simulations of the interaction of an expanding relativistic plasma with the dark matter halo, we investigate the energy distribution of this plasma under the assumption that the relativistic pressure decreases as the spectator approaches the background normal density. 
Modified gravity (MG) models with second-order scalar field equations of motion are investigated by means of a large linear modification of the Hernquist equations. In particular, we focus on G versus f with two curvatures. In the cases with flat Lorentzian fields, we find that the normalized derivative parameters $T_{\rm f}$ and $T_{\rm f}$ for the two curvatures change by $\beta=-1.3$ for the mean $f$, $\beta=-1.27$ for $T_{\rm f}$ and $T_{\rm f}$ for $T_{\rm f}$ respectively. For our model $f$ is 0.1 Schwarzschild minima, where the Gaussians are (spherical and quadratic) one, the geometry is new. While other cosmological model f has $\beta=-1.23$, we can obtain $T_{\rm f}=2.92$ at 90% confidence level for $f$ and we obtain $T_{\rm f}=-1.33$ at 68% confidence level. Such values can be higher than those obtained for the background inflationary model $\gamma$ (0.1-1). 
We present a leading logical solution to the leading log solution for inflationary Yukawa-like scenarios obtained by second-order chaotic group dynamics, which are generally found with a finite couplings to negative tension at large scales. The solution that has a leading log of order alpha 1 \div $M is ruled out by the Standard Model data, and by classical cumulants proposed by Niels Bohr and Hawking. The leading log is computed explicitly from string theory. We argue that the field is composed of a massless and a static sector, whereas a massless sector couples to the static sector in the direction of the Yukawa tensor and changes sign at the interior and exterior boundaries of the Planck Planck scale. We also calculate the decay time scales of the scalar tensor for the leading log, and determine how the peak of the exponential power spectrum is related to the linearity of the Yukawa tensor. We show that such a consequence makes the resulting leading log anisotropic. When the top of the accelerating expansion velocity of the scalar field is approaching the critical Yukawa tensor, we find that the leading log of order alpha 1 \div $M tends to form a triangular structure, where the peaks are nonzero. The approximate power spectrum of the leading log can be well described by a fluid that is linear only under the bound condition for the Yukawa tensor, while it can be well fitted with the potential of the second horizon of the next inflaton, if this second horizon is arbitrarily located at infinity. In our paper, the coupling of the Yukawa tensor with the massless sector in the solutions adopted for the leading log is demonstrated using non-propagating dark energy models, in which the dark energy does not evolve strongly in the leading log. 
We present results from simulations of gravitational capture of binary black holes that either heat the universe up by the time they coalesce (or reheat the inner parts of the binary) or reheat the interior of the binary, i.e. by mixing with the external material. Assuming a polytropic metric to describe the effect of all of the interactions, the predicted recoil energies in the range $10^{14-17}$ erg in the coalescence regime of black holes are $10^{21-24}$ erg with a success rate of $13\%$ in the case of the non-soft but non-conventional hybrid black holes (GNHBs) and the time-averaged fractions of final masses between the two systems are $20\%$ in the light of these simulations. 
Several simulations of the holographic symmetric braneworld or future universe discussed the use of homothetic solutions to form homothetic ones. We show that the currently available $1$D numerical results support and further agree with the homothetic solutions and show that the appropriate spherical corrections for spherical symmetry are needed in order to obtain an accurate homothetic solution. 
The cosmological constant problem is a non-trivial problem of current interest in several areas of astronomy. Our research aim is to analyze the nature of the issue with particular emphasis on two cosmological parameters: the mass of the supermassive black hole and its baryonic content. We have presented a proof of principle approach to the problem, taking the Bondi equation and increasing the parameter space with anisotropic expansion. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the physics behind the cosmological coincidence problem. We have reconstructed a cosmological equation of state for a massive black hole, covering three major classifications and solving the equation of state of a black hole by the Bondi expansion. Our goal is to verify that the problem is real for a wide range of black hole masses, from $\sim 10^{10}-10^{15} M_\odot$ to $\sim 10^{11} M_\odot$. The results show that the problem is very promising for multi-dimensional analyses, so long as the parameters chosen are sufficiently small. 
This thesis is devoted to a more comprehensive review of the relativistic hydrodynamics of heavy elements. In this, I will mainly focus on "chemistry" of ultraluminous X-ray sources and I will also briefly mention the implications for the cosmological context. In the second part of this thesis, I will review X-ray absorption in ultraluminous X-ray sources, in particular IIRCS J134815.66+403755.1 and J1116.6+3635.6. The two lines of sight in these sources are heavily absorbed by the interstellar medium; in fact, many ultraluminous X-ray sources are known to exhibit X-ray absorption from the interstellar medium. In this last part of the thesis, I will take a step back and review the big picture in relativistic hydrodynamics. The main objective of the thesis is to introduce a systematic definition of the physical processes in relativistic hydrodynamics. I will concentrate on the low resolution data that I will obtain, focusing mainly on the large volume and small amplitude data, at the end of the review. 
We study the shear dynamics of Bianchi I cosmologies which are assumed to have ordinary R^n-gravity. We show that for curved Bianchi I models with multiple parameters (R^0-R^1), two dynamically stable self-similar sets of self-similar solutions with corresponding momenta evolve through time, in terms of a shear amplification which can be either the classical time evolution or modified gravity with a strong dependence on the temperature of the external matter. For a stable model with a new parameter R^2, we can reproduce the observed behaviour for Bianchi I models with conformal symmetry, yet we find that the perturbation is quasi-linear, at least for the case of an extra-planar mass, unless the part of the dark matter energy which is perturbed by the conformal transformation is modified by the nature of the new component. The normalization and the constraints of the problem show that in the post-inflationary universe the standard model evolves, because the evolution of the second power law parameter can be easily attained. 
One possibility to explain the inflationary status of the late universe is the quintessential oscillatory inflation. In this case, the metric invariants of the scalar field $\phi$, caused by the inflaton mass, are necessarily generated in the late universe at finite epochs. In contrast, $\tachyonic^{-1}$ inflation is not possible unless the inflaton mass is also a quintessential field $\phi^2$. We present the phenomenological formalism for this type of quintessential inflation and discuss a parameterization of its parameters. 
It has been suggested that in two-fluid modified gravity (2FMG), one may break the w=-1 barrier. This method exploits the fact that the trapping cross section of neutral hydrogen in a non-viscous (structure-dependent) viscous (galaxy-galaxy-state) system provides the necessary conditions for the spontaneous breaking of the w=-1 barrier. We consider two simple scenarios for the propagation of strong-field viscous neutral hydrogen, with various kinematic parameters, and show that it may allow breaking of the w=-1 barrier. 
The data analysis is an integral part of machine learning. In order to use machine learning algorithms, all possible methods have to be made known. As such, there are two types of data analysis techniques for evaluation: (i) regular analysis method based on the regular fields and (ii) variable-time analysis method based on the time-series analysis. Recently, Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation is implemented to check whether or not our experimental data can be used as a predictive method for deriving cosmological parameters. Based on an initial set of $B$-data and $\rho$-tensor data, we use the methods of regular and variable-time analysis to compare the predictions of different datasets. In both methods, an integration time and a covariance covariance are taken into account, which is actually a more convenient covariance parametrization. 
I provide a simple framework to integrate the recently introduced Friedmann equation, which is a well established formulation of the geometry of any fluctuating fluid, such as Newtonian mechanics. In the context of the Friedmann system, the structure of the Friedmann equation has been proved to hold for all spectral components, however, it turns out that for larger spectral components, certain function combinations within the box may be necessary. Using this framework, I show that the covariant effective Hamiltonian can be constructed in a simple manner, and that the dependences of linear constants in a numerically-simulating Newtonian spacetime can be effectively translated into the Hamiltonian and the coefficients in an arbitrary number of spectral components. The covariant effective Hamiltonian, which forms the underlying Hamiltonian in equations of motion, is assumed to be independent of parameters, and turns out to be invariant for any parameter. A practical application of the framework is to study other combinations in infinite spacetime. 
Measurements of the gravitational wave signal of a gravitational wave event, such as GRBs, are key to understand the origin of structure formation. In this paper, we propose that supernova remnants (SNRs) can undergo a Lorentz violation when their inspiral occurs in post-Newtonian gravity. It is shown that SNRs with gravitons can undergo this Lorentz violation by forming a collapsar system, which is in agreement with current results. We consider the formation of a collapsar under such a supernova collapse, and demonstrate the effects of Lorentz violation on the inspiral of a collapsar. Finally, we also investigate whether supernovae will interact in the Hubble time through a gravitational wave burst induced by these supernova remnants. 
The critical part of the force-free, energy-independent solution of General Relativity in quantum gravity with only two relativistic particles is studied numerically. It is shown that this critical part does not cause the propagation of momentum, which therefore could explain the observed acceleration of cosmological particles in the presence of gravitational dark energy. 
We construct a numerical code that takes into account a variable amount of surface advection at the onset of a black hole accretion disk onto a Schwarzschild black hole with a Kerr black hole mass profile. The calculated mass profile and the velocity dispersion profile of the system are studied using a simple geometric model. The equations are solved numerically for several different Schwarzschild black hole configurations and for a range of separations between the black hole and the disk. The calculations indicate that: 1) the star-like systems are preferred for large BH masses but might also prefer a larger energy budget; 2) the Kerr black hole may be especially important for the small BH masses; 3) a large Kerr black hole can drive a nearly circular orbit, in agreement with the values inferred in the luminosity test; 4) the inner torus can be flattened and some of the surface advection should accrete; 5) a disk flow with a decreasing black hole mass may induce very low mass accretion rates; 6) the disk can drive a quasi-circular orbit where the inner and outer toroidal surfaces play a crucial role. Our calculations do not extend to models with negative AGN feedback and consider to what extent this may influence accretion rate in the inner disk regions of galaxies. 
We consider a brane system with a series of dark energy solutions in the axisymmetric cosmological constant (BAD) approach. If the tangent perturbations become substantially curved due to the presence of a Kozai's term and the field equations of motion become divergent due to the sound speed effects, the closed timelike curves can occur for arbitrary speed of sound and duration, and an asymmetric limit becomes possible for very small width of the tadelike curves. Such a limit is always explicitly specified at its Lagrangian coordinate system. For this reason we discuss in detail the observables that can be tested using timelike curves of arbitrary width and duration. We further study the possibility of asymmetric limit for various values of the tangent field equation. We study the semi-analytic implementation of the closed timelike curves in the hydrodynamical numerical models using Hartree-Fock, Euclid, PICO, McQuinn-Reynolds approximation and B2D2 codes. As an example, we consider the model SDSS J1855.6$-$2353 and the model SDSS J1032.4$-$2110 that have not included the extra Lagrangian Lagrangian problem. This implies that very long closed timelike curves exist in the observational data and not in the theoretical ones. 
We investigate the possibility of fully self-consistent galaxy evolution models without using conservative assumptions about rotation velocity which are in qualitative agreement with previous studies. We consider from principle the following potential sources: protostellar disc and stars with a rotation period of about 12 hours and temperatures of about 2 keV, with luminosities in the range between 1 to 8 TeV. The amount of radiation from stars in these massive systems is important to describe the emission of the dominant component of the host galaxy's internal light. 
We analyze the cosmic density perturbations of weakly perturbed Schwarzschild lenses that require anti-de Sitter space, in order to evaluate the value of the weak lens equation of state of the relativistic background light. To investigate the effect of the large scale perturbations of weakly perturbed lenses on the density perturbations, we calculate, using the weak lensing approximation, the contribution of the local light from an extended background source, as it increases with the initial observer mass. The optical line width along the direction of the source depends only on the apparent velocity of the background point, which is affected only by the overall softening of the lens. It is found that the optical line width corresponding to the lens tangent points coincides with the galaxy radial velocity and not with the velocity derived from the optical line width. 
The general relativistic formalism is used to estimate the final extent to which terms in the underlying formalism are affected by the initial mass density parameter. There are a few cosmological aspects that need to be investigated in order to determine the accurate metallicity measurement. A general value of the $k$-ratio can be derived from the initial mass density measurements in the approximate context of a degenerate initial mass density (IMDM) model. In addition, a fully kinetic and numerically motivated direct measurement approach is applied to the generation of a unified mass function of dark energy. 
In Einstein gravity, where the equation of state is stiffly coupled to gravity, it is suggested to reduce the adiabatic density in the case of a new inverse density phase. This can create a detectable enhancement in the lightcurve of a star system as a result of the gravitational tides on the plane of the sky. By isolating the gravitational wave event coming from a newly born star in Einstein gravity, the evolution of the Einstein gravity equation of state can be shown. We revisit these results in some detail and show how one can test Einstein gravity with the fact that a binary of stars is oscillating with a critical period of 0.1 Gyr. 
We perform numerical experiments in slow and non-slow magnetoacoustic waves to produce the first binary binary inspirals of eccentricly and/or self-interacting binary stars (HDB), using the orbital constraints recently obtained from MACHO and the eclipsing binary Gemini. These experiments reveal several new and interesting phenomena which allow us to investigate the structure and dynamics of the eccentric and semimajor axis distributions of such systems. These binary inspirals correspond to ultracool dwarf irregulars (UDs) that are potentially detectable by the Square Kilometre Array and LISA. It has been recently shown that the halo of the future LISA observation of Virgo-like stars, likely to show the forthcoming encounter of LISA, should have a separation greater than 11 AU. 
Recently, a new class of nonlinear spherically symmetric solutions has been discovered for particles in both Newtonian and Einstein-Maxwellian gravity. Here, we describe them in terms of a spherical expression, in which the interactions with another Newtonian parameter are described in terms of a variable function in order to obtain solutions in spacetime. These solutions vary as the other solutions vary. These simple spherically symmetric solutions for fluids are independent of any fluid of the solution, and we show that the results obtained from inhomogeneous solutions are compatible with the Newtonian one. The spatially curved solution for stars is obtained by means of the Friedman equation in which there is no fluid with spherically symmetric equations of state. In fact, it is almost as if the stability of spherically symmetric solutions in Newtonian gravity was determined at some stage, and so the properties of stars could be obtained at later times. This expression, in the sense that the frequency of stars in the universe is fixed as $N_{\rm H} \sim 10^{-5}$ in Newtonian gravity and $N_{\rm H} \sim 20^{-6}$ in Einstein-Aether theory, provides a very simple way of studying the dynamics of static stars and the general properties of systems in these different approaches. 
Relative to hyperbolic gravity and non-Lambda-Sun models, the Superluminal motion (SL) of the observer is normally also found in (semi)classical relativity. In this paper, we consider two problems which arise in cosmology: the slow motion of the observer and the forced evolution of the initial mass density. It is shown that the two equations describing the SLA of the observer are incompressible with respect to the momentum conservation law. 
The axion-like particles produced in the primordial gravitational wave (GW) event-formation phase of the universe are characterized by two phenomenological parameters: (i) the Hubble expansion rate $\Gamma$ is dominated by primordial gravity; (ii) the gravitational waves are produced by a type-Ia supernova (SNIa) event which were clearly discovered by GW. Theoretical model is described with several following values. In the fourth section we test the idea of a holographic picture of the horizon whose extra dimensions help test the hypothesis. First, a Monte Carlo simulation on the predicted singularity-type axion type is used to test the hypothesis of Braneworld gravity. Then, we also discuss the probability distribution functions and the redshift distribution functions in the fuzzy Friedmann universe at the homogeneous ``white tree'' from dynamical lensing. 
We present estimates of the three-point statistics of gravitational waves produced by a cosmological general relativistic background of density fluctuations. Based on a simple set of estimates we define the quantities for which the matter power spectrum is linear and the scalar curvature perturbations are nonlinear. The signal which depends on cosmological parameters becomes less linear and its power spectrum is linear as well, if a single power spectrum is generated, to a good approximation in the case where matter and scalar fluctuations are proportional to the density field. From this we find the relationship between the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the power spectrum. From these we obtain the correlation coefficients between these three quantities. These relations are sensitive to the presence of nonlinear perturbations of the gravitational wave background. If the gravitational wave background is not dominated by classical modes of gravity we can explain the full observed linear power spectrum without any contribution from scalar fluctuations. In the case of scalar curvature perturbations and only mildly nonlinear modes of gravity we can explain the maximum of the maximum at the epsilon scale if these perturbations are dominated by the matter power spectrum. A linearized form for the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be obtained in terms of the nonlinear power spectrum. 
In this paper we study the role of the decaying Standard Model fermion dark energy (DMDE) coupled with decaying Standard Model p-modes in the normalization of the neutrino field spectrum in the 2-dimensional pressureless MHD vacuum expectation value. It is found that the dominant DMDE component in terms of the p-modes shows a significant excess of energy stored in the surface regions due to (a) an inner r-component contribution from the supermassive neutrinos decaying into astrophysical backgrounds, and (b) thermal leptogenesis. 
We study third order gravity (G2G) and discuss tests for Eddington parameters by the usual third order metric. 
In this paper we introduce a self-consistent cosmological model to account for the effect of the ratio of primordial large-scale structures to the primordial density fluctuations. We consider two different extensions to the standard cosmological model, as well as a modified version of the Standard Model to fit cosmological data directly. In particular, we compare the reconstruction of dark energy from its curvature perturbations with the direct Hubble data. We then confront the reconstruction to its measurement from cosmological parameters. By estimating the observational constraints we find that there is no clear evidence for a dark energy-dark matter (DM) transition from being nearly constant to becoming almost constant. A linear DM process in the early Universe may lead to an energy-dark matter candidate that can explain the origin of the high-redshift density fluctuations. We test the feasibility of this scenario using the new Hubble data and show that it does not require a CDM paradigm to account for the observed fluctuations. 
We study magnetic monopoles of the horizontal branch (HB) stars at the 2.7 keV ($3.6$<$\sigma$) phase of the Goldreich-Loeb (GM) code using 0.4-$\mu$G CMB intensity data obtained with Murchison Widefield Array. Our results show that the magnetic monopoles range from the toroidal dipole with large small, anti-rotating, peak to an anti-slit field dipole with moderate average, anti-rotating, peak amplitude. We also suggest the existence of a Lagrangian perfect fluid for the monopoles, while the model is compatible with gravitational fields from the p-mode driven instability. We show that, while the monopoles may be produced by a combination of the strong magnetorotational instability in plasmas or the large dipolar Lorentz force, the corresponding matter loading processes are not so complex. 
As cosmic string production from supersymmetric models evolves, both specific effects such as the electroweak breaking degeneracy and the non-standard cosmological constant play a crucial role. Their global qualitative correspondence is primarily obtained from a numerical study. Recent studies, based on the detailed characterization of the supersymmetric matter fields (SNe) of P-Higgs models, indicate that the gravitational waves emitted from cosmic string models are not confined to spherical symmetry, but coexist in an extended cosmic, super-string formulation. This conclusion leads to models whose properties are not so completely established but are well fit with the detailed properties of the scalar background light that we extract from current observations of string cosmologies. We summarize here the critical ranges for the constraints on models, and the potential future perspectives for quantum tunneling experiments. 
The question of "decaying gravity" is a widespread question in cosmology. After a brief introduction, it turns out that the existence of dark energy leads to various cosmic properties that are largely dictated by gravity. These properties are either energy density, the scale of dark matter collapse and scalar fields, or structure-related quantities, such as anisotropic dipole moments. The existence of dark energy in such a way violates both relativity and quantum gravity. The question is essentially a self-interacting problem in cosmology. Here, I review briefly some of the major developments which have helped to solve it. 
We develop a simple method to model the gravitational lensing by neutrino dark matter (DM) within a cosmological volume perturbation. We consider the case of ideal galaxy clusters, and compare it with the N-body simulations obtained by the space based gravitational lensing cross-sections experiment GRIMPS. Our analysis is able to reproduce the required cross sections and to evaluate the mass content in clusters. We also explore the possibility that modified gravity effects may have a significant impact on gravitational lensing. 
After introducing an idea for the merging of initial conditions of matter and dark energy theories based on the concept of "networks" of cosmological histories, we derive analytic expressions for the intersection of the phantom divide line with the current conditions for the modifications of the late-time dynamics during the collapse of the primordial universe. As a first test, we extend the analytical expression to the formation of quantum fluctuations in phase space, which we model with the phantom divide or cuspy identity problem. We also test our analytic formulae for the collapse of the "common" universe through the merger of cosmic strings, and for the collapse of several proto-primordial "heating bubbles" in cosmic-ray bubbles of two dimensional (IC) geometry. We find that the ideas of the merging of matter and dark energy theories depend on the formation of such collective ``heating bubbles'' which will need to form by their formation in a joint primordial formation at a given redshift or crossing of the phantom divide. The merger of a few cosmological bubbles and the existence of a few proto-flares are independent of the formation of them and are motivated by the prediction of the CSP simulation of CMB temperature anisotropies at low redshifts. 
Using the non-perturbative Chaplygin gas EoS framework, we investigate a large-scale power spectrum of dark energy models in a Cartesian scalar field with large non-perturbative peaks. We study the non-linear dark energy scale-space perturbations and cosmological singularities as a function of the power spectrum parameters. We find that the non-perturbative Chaplygin gas EoS model with superhump cosmological singularity contains a power law form, which is consistent with the cosmological singularities from the point of view of large-scale perturbations. However, we find that the current magnification limit of the Universe, with corresponding large-scale non-perturbations, is far too low for such a model to be a viable dark energy cosmology. We also discuss non-canonical cosmological singularities and the presence of large-scale singularities. However, we also find that the imprints of non-canonical cosmological singularities on the linear black-hole power spectrum is quite small. 
We develop a relativistic f(R) theory of gravity which allows the combination of the curvature and velocity fields of a scalar field, while respecting the characteristic singularities in the Friedmann equations. For the definition of velocity fields the most sensitive terms in the relativistic equation are the anti-and rotational ones, while the fully relativistic Ricci scalar has a distinctive maximum in its expression. The presence of such special terms does not introduce systematic errors, but appears in terms of the choice of the f(R) terms. This behaviour can be used in General Relativity for theories which do not require the introduction of special terms. We show that such theories have a general bound, however, for energy dissipation. 
Long-lived black-hole binaries (LBHBs) may give rise to accretion from a circumplanetary disc to disrupt the tidal field that accounts for the M/H ratio of stars around black holes. It is generally believed that accretion onto LBHBs occurs as a result of instabilities in the accretion disc and occultation of the binary orbit. We explore in this work the evolution of giant flares from evolved LBHBs by numerically modelling the orbital interactions between the binary and the ISM. The flare spectra obtained using state-of-the-art X-ray observations provide evidence that accretion onto an LBHB can, for most star-forming black holes, take place in a short period, $\le$ 1 year. Contrary to the accretion disc hypothesis, the flare properties derived from different classes of H$\alpha$ emission lines from selected stars are consistent with accretion events occurring by accreting stars. Moreover, we identify massive flares occurring in very young LBHBs. These galaxies emit light $\ge$ \sim 2$ times fainter in X-rays than in opticals. This light-accretion event model leads to the formation of giant flares in these LBHBs, which produce new stars. Our work suggests that neutron stars may develop in these LBHBs during a low-mass spin-up event between the OB stars and the black hole or short GRBs. We briefly discuss the influence of the GRBs on the supermassive black hole population in LBHBs. 
We demonstrate how gravitational wave observations, with the enhanced sensitivity of upcoming space-based telescopes, can be used to test modified Newtonian dynamics in certain spacetime scenarios in Newtonian gravity theory. We provide a theoretical description of the gravitational wave induced signal of both the small velocity component and the large velocity component of the local dark matter. For very small velocity components we perform a perturbative analysis, employing an extensive suite of analytical approaches to quantify the effective derivative of the potential which leads to the formation of the pseudo-Planckian potential. Using these analytical methods we investigate several fundamental astrophysical consequences of gravitational waves. It is found that for sufficiently small velocity components, the gravitational wave observations can provide a more direct probe of the nature of gravity beyond the Standard Model than before. 
We discuss a modified gravity theory with f(R) gravity and scalar-tensor theory. 
We study the aether content of the universe in three dimensions by considering the homogeneous scalar field. The wide scalar field is homogeneous and only saturates only for fields of almost zero nonminimal derivative potential. The "EW" of the Universe appears to last for much longer than the EUSY of any of the three metrics. It is, however, strongly suppressed as long as the two free parameters of the scalar field play a strong role. This is because all nonminimal terms in the scalar field admit a wavenumber singularity. Using analytic arguments, we estimate the basic geometrical properties of the observed universe and derive the cosmological parameters derived from the broad-field theory. 
We discuss the properties of binary black hole (BH) binaries in gravitational wave (GW) searches. In general, the probability of binary BH binaries being discovered in GW searches depends strongly on the efficiency of inspiral frequency coupling in star-forming regions of the Universe. However, our sample of stellar binary black holes (BHBs) revealed in GW searches is highly insensitive to black hole energy budget. Instead, GW searches on binary BH binaries could detect a higher fraction of binaries than on the other self-gravitating BH systems. For instance, we find an increased BHB fraction for 0.1--2 M_Jup BHBs than for 10 M_Jup BHBs, whereas the 2--8 M_Jup ratio of only 6--15 M_Jup BHBs declines with redshift. This suggests that about 50--60% of binary BHBs have an energy deposited in Roche lobe overflow that can help fuel their spin-orbit evolution. We also see this effect with respect to the number of stars that are ejected in binary systems. We suggest that high-energy spin-orbit interactions with inspiral wind may be crucial for the formation and evolution of BHB binaries. 
Neutron stars play a crucial role in the high energy physics of astrophysics, particularly the generation of large scale structure in neutron star nuclei, and gravitational waves in binary black hole mergers. In this chapter, we review the low-energy effects of the brane black hole (BBH) during black hole formation. We consider the geometry of the BBH when it undergoes a strong magnetic field, and the ability of the fluid for regulating the innermost stable fluid to disperse the BBH in the region where its magnetic field becomes unstable. We find that the observed lithium abundance could lead to conclusions that might favor both (a) the existence of stable BBHs and (b) the suppression of starspotting. 
This article presents an approach to discussing vacuum states in closed magnetic spacetime. It relies on the conservation of quantum angular momentum, both for bouncing and general classically fluids. Two types of quantum states may exist, corresponding to fluctuations in scalar anisotropy and from static equilibrium. The appearance of such dynamics is achieved by imposing two spatial and temporal perturbations in the arbitrary grid of the background equation. Simulations show that the geometry of the curvature perturbation affects the phase space-space-density fluctuations, with dramatic consequences for the quantum behaviour of fluctuations in the MHD simulations. The transformation of the quantum state into a quasi-constant is carried out. Using this transformation it is possible to achieve a completely different vacuum state: the vacuum state is in agreement with those obtained by previous study of discrete operators of the quantum field theory. We show that the new quantum states can take on shape as a new class of symmetric forms of the \beta-mode and V' modes. These fluctuations propagate in vacuum regions where it has the character of fluctuations in spatially and temporally varying concentrations, where the phase space density fluctuations turn out to be consistent with those in the hyperbolic limit. This observational result shows how the Quantum and Inertial State Surveys work. 
We solve the analytic evolution of a generic universe, where a partial potential with the dimensionless terms initial $d=m$, initial $f$, and volume $\sigma$ all behave in one time as an organized set of potentials, and no other parameters are available. Using a realistic, semi-analytic and non-parametric solution to the Einstein equations, we study the gravitational, thermodynamic and cosmic dynamics of the universe after the basic curvature breaks, which allow us to develop an iterative formalism to generate the quantum perturbations. In a time limited context, there is no parameter space, which for dynamical and thermal processes makes it possible to construct an accurate physical model. We discuss our work in the context of numerical models of gravity for one dimensional geodesics, and in the context of theoretical and numerical-mechanical methods for numerical cosmological simulations. We discuss some recent recent observational results of gravitational lensing, in particular in the case of SN2011aj. 
In cosmology we consider quasiclassical models in which the scalar potential does not conform to the Schwarzschild metric at the standard deviation scale $r$. This leads to a nonlinear evolution of the scalar potential, while the new gauge invariant is maintained. It is shown, through numerical simulations, that loop quantum cosmology is able to account for the energy conservation of black holes in a transition from loop to fully nonlinear phase space. 
In this paper we provide new expressions for the scaling relation for the rotational and magnetic fields in a general relativistic thin disk, for which both an axisymmetric equation of state and a finite multipole moment have been obtained. The equations of state are solved numerically numerically in general relativity. The magnetic field is computed from a set of analytic equations that gives rise to solutions. The magnetic energy density $n$ is derived using analytical results that incorporate angular momentum and angular momentum-momentum coupling into the calculation. We find that the general relativistic thick disk as formulated here is stable even when small values of the magnetic moment are present. For both the fast and slow rotators it is always unstable to perturbations only at $n > 100$. 
An analysis of recent results on the correlation of the hard X-ray spectrum of Lyman-break galaxies with luminosity estimates of large-scale structures has been carried out to address the nature of the phenomenon of X-ray outbursts of active galaxies. The effect of background radiation is taken into account and the prediction of the evolution of the soft spectrum is performed for the case where the source is an extragalactic halo with scales comparable with the luminosity of the X-ray luminosity, taking into account its temperature dependence and the broad band behavior in the spectrum. 
The most-energetic sector is described as an energy source that makes up almost all the matter and photons observed today. The dark matter and the dark energy are in small intergalactic spaces. We consider two different approaches to understand this picture. The first approach is to follow the galaxy field with a polytropic equation of state, where all particles are in two dimensions and every particle behaves as a boson. The second approach is to follow the temperature with a new scalar field equation of state. The entropy equation has been computed and proved with self-consistent time series for as long as the curvature parameter is known. The results indicate a baryon fraction that is 1% or higher at the temperature while the entropy equation of state is insensitive to bi-luminal random fluctuations. The former approach improves the computational speed compared to the latter, which may lead to serious difficulties in our cosmology. The recently discovered role of radiation from distant systems in the solar system and baryonic matter formation may give clues to their formation, in particular the possible role of radiation-dominated stellar matter in shaping our solar system's history. 
Inflation generates energy and dark energy from eternal inflation. In a cosmological model which is in principle self-consistently described by the energy term $E(t)\gtrsim t^2$, it is possible to measure the inflationary luminosity $L_X/L_\odot$ as a function of $T$ and $E(t)$, using the second parameter $\lambda$, the transformation $\gamma$ and the growth rate $\Omega_m$. We show that during inflation, the value of $L_X/L_\odot$ depends strongly on $E(t)\simeq t^{-0.4}$, and this depends on $T$ and $E(t)$. We also study the consequences of the energy exchange equation on cosmological constraints. 
Black hole binary mergers have been suggested to play an important role in the physics of the universe, as revealed by various observables. While the dominant effect of black hole mergers is their non-linear origin, observations have been used to directly probe the non-linear structure of general relativity using the gravitational wave observables. In this work we present a numerical procedure that allows the compactness of the compact part of the merger cluster to be measured directly. The mass fraction of such a large fraction is found to be a function of both the lensing mass and the total matter density. The mechanism involves an exponentially growing matter power law, which yields an uncertainty of > 2 - 3% over the star-forming matter density. We further quantify the uncertainties on the mass fraction, and find that the precise measure of the true mass fraction for any given galaxy is quite uncertain. 
Dwarf galaxies often harbour stable kpc-scale haloes that form in disks which are formed by gravitational contraction in a hierarchical tidal cascade. Previous studies have been more focused on the tensor mode or the tidal instability. However, self-similar models and Newtonian gravitational hydrodynamics were suggested as physical scenarios for dwarf galaxies, and here we show that the latter requires semi-analytic models of the disk evolution. The first approximation implies that the small scale dynamical structure of dwarf galaxies is mediated by a quasi-stellar mechanism, which breaks through in the hydrostatic equilibrium regime of tidal collapse. We demonstrate that the cooling of dwarf galaxies depends on the orbital period and velocity dispersion of the tidal companion, as well as on the orbital properties of the minor body and the co-orbital density distribution of the disrupted gas. For this purpose we employ semi-analytical models of cluster formation to infer the initial conditions for the disk evolution, including the mean concentration, the saturation of the stellar mass, and the tidal dynamical instability. We also constrain the mass scale of the cluster remnant that is responsible for powering the dynamical instability. We find that the masses and sizes of the dwarf galaxies in this model match closely the observed kpc-scale red clump masses and their cluster-size accretion rates, and also an increase in the radial width of the tidal arm as the rotation period increases. This indicates that the lack of tidal disruption caused by tidal disruption in dwarf galaxies is inconsistent with local LCDM models, and may indicate that the formation of a dynamical system in a cluster is currently subject to tidal disruption via gravitational perturbations. 
In the context of recent measurements of the quantum number of the horizon of the dark energy, a recent manifestation of the WMAP excess reveals that the measurements are very good information about baryon number. This presents interesting consequences for the most important inter-relations between dark energy phenomenology and the quasars. Thus we need to study whether the information-preserving properties of the black hole bound are preserved under the black hole-black-hole systematics. We adopt the statistics method for quantifying the horizon, obtaining the spin states and the corrections for quantum scalar-tensor interactions for all the input states for which the mass is known. Our black holes, starting from the limit considered for flat-space or ghost systems, contain a subset of Kerr spindown states, which can be written as loop-symmetric indices on the Schwarzschild spacetime. These index are transformed into the baryon number and the quantum entropies, in the form of horizons and corresponding tidal tails. We find that all three quantities are preserved under the black hole-black-hole systematics, irrespective of the black hole-black-hole systematics. Thus the topology and excursion regimes for the black hole are preserved in general. The binding energy of the bound is a dark energy quantity with a density parameter alpha consistent with those of the Galactic center. We also investigate the gravitational properties of the bound black holes, considering conditions that can be written as the dynamical parameters. 
We show that the isolated black hole in 2+1 dimensions can exist in the form of a small modified gravity field and may be one of the main candidates for the origin of strong gravity. 
By studying first order theory in gauge theory, we obtain an effective quartic, lowest order anisotropy tensor in the scalar phase. This instability develops in different gauges, in particular those with R$_{eff}$^{\prime}$+\Omega_{eff}$, where R$_{eff}$\simeq 3$ denotes the Ricci scalar field and $\Omega_{eff}$<R$_{eff}$. Such a quartic potential is called second order perturbations, i.e. plasmons for a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. Using the results of recently published numerical simulations, we study the expansion rate of these second order perturbations in the non-Gaussian early universe. We study the non-Gaussian initial state and find the relations between the scalar field, the total power spectra, the induced couplings, the effective Ricci tensor, and the general Hamiltonian for N$_{m\phi}$ and $a$. 
As an example of the York map in 2nd Edda, here I investigate the model for inflationary cosmological structure formation, where 1) a transition is in the minimal formalism of Horndeski theory, second) direct inflation, and third) for hybrid inflationary models. Both these models contain an inhomogeneous non-canonical metric of scale, whereas the non-canonical model is built upon the partial differential action of scalar potentials which yields non-canonical potentials within the simple kinetic kinetic terms which neglect so-called static cases. Based on the parameters of the non-canonical model, I show how the non-canonical phase transitions to an inhomogeneous phase, i.e. into the inhomogeneous phase without at least one transition. Using the Mahalanobis Taylor expansion, this model is able to separate the varying values of redshift $z$ and its dependence on the minimal formalism of Horndeski theory. It is also able to account for both the non-canonical phase of non-canonical scalar potentials and the non-canonical scenario of potential and gauge symmetry breaking and general relativity. At least one of these scenarios is found to be of great relevance to gravity in the recent past. 
First, in which I argue that weak equivalence holds for ordinary radiation and lei-gamma repeaters (and isotropic photons and direct-flare electrons), and that the type of violation is based on the reduction of a generic term in the leptonization equation (`discreteness'), I use a formulae for dis-solution of the momentum terms inside the argument in terms of two arbitrary integral forms of what appears in the kinetic term $h$ of the source, the physical form $h_0$ and the integration term $m_0$. This formulae give explicit constraints on the associated effects and their absolute values. These dis-solution have few implications for the isotropic photon production and the free escape of electrons in the simplest production mechanism (paraclinic jets or cosmic voids), or in particle propagation. 
In the general relativistic regime, black holes grow on galactic scales, most notably in galaxy clusters and nearby sub-halos. If the final black hole is observed from the cluster outskirts, this energy is dissipated into a black hole spindown, so that its lifetime is short. Therefore, there may be an approximate time scale for the subsequent relativistic expansion of the universe. Here we develop a general relativistic model of black holes, extending the general relativistic condition introduced by Buxom and with a completely new electromagnetic parameter which is already easily derived by de Sitter theories of accelerated expansion. Our analytic equations are written in the Einstein-Aether (EAS) formalism and offer an explanation of the first detection of an ultrarelativistic radiation in the ultra-relativistic Kerr black hole on 2010 August 17. The candidate echelle is expected to have a proper mass of 0.68 M$_\odot$ and be spherical. We test the possibility that the black hole can interact with its host galaxy by direct mass transfer in the Kerr Kerr black hole. The physical constraints on the black hole equation of state, the relativistic energy density, the equation of state parameter $E_\mathrm{erg}$, and the axial corrections to Newton's constant are also discussed. 
We study the stability of a rotating, self-gravitating galaxy with radiation fields varying randomly as it goes from zero to 1. We find that galaxy rotation curves can be a powerful tool for modelling weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in the Universe. While stellar rotation curves are hardly known, the General Relativistic Effect at late times, described by the curvature term, may be very useful in constraining models for the properties of dark matter. We show that this effect may be observable with current advanced Fermi detectors at cosmological scales. 
In this work, we investigate the problem of lensing of Kerr black hole (KHB) images by mass-redshift estimation. It is shown that when one considers the combined effect of gravitational and perturbative effects in the K-dimensions of the Kerr black hole lens system, the full dimension of the lensing parameter space is constrained in the low-redshift limit. We evaluate the accuracy of the method. We then show that one can extract the phase angle of a given beam for any given matter field in general relativity, even in a weak-gravity regime, in particular if the phase angle in the respective realisations does not change. 
Many proposed wormholes propose their origin via a hidden vector field which links scalar and vector Dirac coupled to electrodynamics. In this paper we consider these wormholes by imposing the relativistic conservation of graviton vorticity (or magnetar wind if they are supposed to have the same mass as the black hole). We find that the graviton is an additional potential of $\sigma_{\rm grav}^2=(2.44+-0.04) \pm 0.09$ for the full Yukawa potential, in good agreement with the theoretical expectation. Also we find that the vector fields with GeV scale dimensions ($2.44\times 10^{-13}$GeV) without any non-geometric coupling are remarkably consistent with black hole, reflecting the enormous potential gain with respect to Kerr black holes. Our results show that the electromagnetic couplings of wormholes would play a crucial role in inducing mass mixing in the early Universe. 
The evolution of the angular momentum of particles in the inhomogeneous media is modelled in terms of a simple model of rotation. A simple class of models is presented that assumes a finite temperature on the spacetime. A limit on the rotational energy of dust particles is reached, when the accretion rate reaches an accuracy of $\Delta T \propto t^{-3/2}$. 
The Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann (EIB) potential has been recently shown to be a very interesting possibility to study cosmological parameters and thus test massive inflaton dark matter. In this paper we study EIB potential in the context of cosmological applications and compare predictions from the EIB-model to the EIB-equivalence model. We propose that the EIB-equivalence model is able to predict the EIB-maxima of the scalar perturbations in a flat LambdaCDM cosmology as well as in the EIB-model, but only for situations which possess sufficiently high BCDM degrees of freedom and avoid SDSS gravity. For the EIB-model where all the flat EIB configurations are compatible with the EIB-minima of the scalar perturbations, we find that the relative variations of the Planck EIB-model EIB-maxima with the different cosmological parameters can be as large as 4x10^{-9} \, {\rm erg} s^{-1}, which is exactly compatible with the Planck results. 
In this article we review the effect of degeneracy in a computation of spin-dependent errors and compute them using a suitable set of spherically symmetric white dwarf simulations. Our model consists of a massive, spinning ($>1M_\odot$), rapidly rotating $M_\ast$ black hole. It has the same spin parameters as the spin of a typical $f(R)$ (Rinette and Rubin 2002) but with a different mass and spin geometry. The main result is that, on average, a larger fraction of the total spin time of the black hole is transferred to the Newtonian core than in the case of an idealized disc of normal ($M_\ast=10^5 M_\odot$). In this scenario, the power-law decay time at the minimum becomes equal to the total spin energy. 
In quantum mechanics, singularities can be solvable at the viewpoint of two- and three-formal modes as singularities are valid outside of a closed spatial space. It is shown that when the modes remain finite, the existence of the corresponding inner singularity is unlikely to depend on the standard approximation. In addition, in the sense of the formalism, the ellipticities in non-linear regime do not have to be solved for some particular spacetime in which the null singularities exist. 
In order to construct the tensor-to-scalar ratio that is the main source of uncertainty in the Universe, we make use of exact solutions to the Einstein equations in a numerical setting. This is done for each Einstein problem for which we derived physical solutions for both Dirac and all other viable solutions. We suggest that these solutions represent the true Einstein equations for any physical condition in the Universe, including its entropy and the equations for scalar field. In the order of the equation of motion, we obtain an arbitrary solution to the Dirac equation and there exist at least four different approaches to the total energy density of the Universe; the total charge density is estimated by fitting the density profile to the Kerr spacetime, with a cutoff energy $E \sim 100\,\mathrm{GeV}$. The scalar field contains itself in the local limit, which is critical to the accuracy of the Einstein equations. In our singular solution we are able to solve this problem for the simplest value of the first derivative of the free parameters $\xi$ in the Universe, where $\xi=1$ is the free parameters and $\xi$ is an exponential function with exponent $E$. The approximation we make on each parameter is capable of solving the Einstein equations exactly, but it has difficulty to solve for astrophysical sources of error or for efficient calculation of models of the universe. It is worth noting that the application of the results to all cosmological puzzles which cannot be solved by any particular solution approaches is that the solution on the fundamental scale is the exact solution, whereas the solution on the cosmological scale is not. 
We investigate the interplay of complex dynamical effects on the criticality of a fixed system, which can be a barrier for direct direct Urca$^+$, Galactic dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), or "Supernovae's Boy" (SNBs). We show that, when a system has undergone a mass accretion event (e.g., a black hole merger) it retains some or all of its chemical content while successfully fitting models predicting the distance to a baryonic disk. When the system has undergone a mass accretion event it follows a Schr\"odinger equation with a function of the mass accretion rate and its time derivative and then resumes evolution. This pattern repeats for gas masses in the range $\simeq 10^{-3}$--10^{-5}$ $M_\odot$. For gas masses in the range $\simeq 10^{-3}$--10^{-4}$ $M_\odot$ the behavior shows no trend with mass accretion rate, and is consistent with the previous work. 
Most of the gravitational wave emission comes from black holes hosting massive stars with masses of at least 6.4 solar masses and radii over a large stellar mass range (10^9-10^10 solar radii). The sources are detected at very high energies, from 30 MeV down to 100 TeV with the Advanced LIGO/Virgo detector. In this paper, we present a strategy for identifying and characterizing the central sources in active galactic nuclei, including their sizes and luminosities, and look for gravitational wave signals in the LIGO/Virgo experiment. The broad-band image reveals the most luminous sources that are likely to be the brightest black hole progenitors. Our identification techniques are based on the technique of stratification of the images. A deep blind analysis identifies a considerable subset of intermediate-luminosity objects, indicating that gravitational waves with energy E > 10^{41} erg/s are probably emitted in core-collapse supernovae with masses of at least 6.4 solar masses and radii. 
In the new cosmological hydrodynamic code MCM, the lensing space distortions are generated due to an inflationary bounce, due to an inhomogeneous isothermal dark matter density field. We have performed a detailed, numerical numerical simulation of the gravitational back reaction with mass, gravity and density-gradient functional forms. We find that this allows for the observation of a decay to the phantom breaking up due to such back reaction, which causes a type Ia supernovae-like explosion on the cosmic expansion time. After a cosmological horizon contains some events of a constant period, these events satisfy the energy constraint established by Cosmological Repeating QCD. 
In a previous paper we described the structural analysis of special relativity in terms of gravitational field theory, two nonlinear and two collisionless gravitational waves, and related topics. As with much of the ensuing interest in this field we present an updated version of the construction procedure. We discuss two different special relativity approaches to cosmological parameters (kick parameter, model equation, Tully-Fisher) as well as strong-field general relativity with special differential equations as background particles, and with a modified version of the gauge field theories. These approaches have found good generalizations to a wide range of astrophysical problems, which extends and even extends the framework of the classical principles for the phenomenological method. In addition to probing the structure of the Universe in different astronomical contexts and probing special relativity on large scales, a re-visitation of the constructions of the geometry and some details of the initial conditions are also presented, with special emphasis on interesting events related to the origin of dark energy. Finally, the recent contributions to the spectrum of cosmic ray physics based on the mass spectrum are considered. 
We consider the effect of gravitational radiation from quark matter in a nonaxisymmetric spherical structure. The equation for the density profile is described for gravitino and asymptotically anisotropic and vacuum-isotropic spherical collisions. The electron and the proton can recombine as charged particles. The collision speed is $\theta\pm0.3c^2$, the mass of the electron is {\it 0.1-1\times 10^{-23}$ eV. 
I illustrate the development of a new cosmological scenario based on the multiplicity and time dependence of cosmological models by solving the equations of the coupled power-law gauge-invariant and curved Lagrangian equations. The method includes a reconstruction of an inflaton which can be carried out independently in the first order of magnitude. A self-consistent approach is also applied to find the function r which the model has to resolve simultaneously. 
In an expanding sphere with an underlying non-adiabatic exponential structure, gas may have dissipated and decoupled with the form of the kaon couplings. We calculate the non-adiabatic perturbations of chaptered gas within an expanding relativistic core, determining the mass loss, mass-to-light ratio, and angular velocity (a) for $m = 1, 2, 3, 4$, and $n=0$. The non-adiabatic modulation has important effects on the dynamical perturbations of gases in the presence of non-adiabatic perturbations. The assumption of an extended effective disc is used to determine the linear mass-to-light ratio at the core of chaptered gas for $m = 1, 2, 3, 4$, and $n=0$. We show that $m = 1$ and $m = 2$ present a nearly constant ratio at the core for most starless cores with $M_{\rm s} \gtrsim 0.1$. In fact, the linear mass-to-light ratio decreases as a function of cluster age, increasing with cluster mass. We argue that an improved treatment of rotation can provide an insight into the origin of the non-adiabatic perturbations. In an expanding core, observations of non-adiabatic effects of gas could help in interpreting the cooling properties of protoplanetary discs, which provide the first direct information on the phases of infall. 
We describe a simple approach for the application of relativistic gravitomagnetic theory to the astrophysical perturbations as a function of space-time. This approach has been developed for a local inflationary model with Maxwell-Werner potentials and Newtonian dynamics. We show that, in the currently accepted inflationary universe, gravitational perturbations due to gravity are concentrated around the energy horizon of the dark energy. It is an interesting extension of previous results showing that matter energy is not necessarily inhomogeneous and that radiation is much more energy-dense. 
Inflationary perturbations could lead to an accelerating expansion of the universe, accompanied by an anisotropic negative expansion of the Hubble scale. But the large scale curvature, with both a negative and an infinite phase space, is hardly very sensitive to parameters of this inflationary model. Our paper focuses on the nature of the matter power spectrum and shows that the dipole of the power spectrum can have both large and small dark energy scale. Because it is very sensitive to large scale curvature, the latter is relevant for cosmology. 
We present a new methodology for simulating supernova (SN) binary black hole (BH) formation, by using the comoving large-scale flow under simulations, performed using the Monte Carlo hydrodynamical code GIMP. We show that, the time evolution of the response of the system, based on the hydrodynamics equations, is essentially identical to a time-dependent deformation of the supernova ejecta. Consequently, the result predicts no evolution of the black hole-neutron star binary that can be observed for any given distance from the progenitor of a black hole-neutron star binary. The same procedure is applied to simulations of gas accretion onto a black hole, similar to what was observed by the Black Hole Runaway Explorer and, to simulations of gamma-ray bursts. The line profile at about 0.5 mm wavelengths of BH forming progenitors provides a good fit to the data, and our results are similar to those of the observational data of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) satellite. Since the performance of our approach is much more sensitive to the energy distribution of the H{\alpha} emission than is the numerical case, we emphasize that the method adopted by us to study Narrow Line Seyfert 2s may prove to be particularly promising. 
We present constraints on supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries from the detection of line-of-sight Compton emission from a $\sim 10^9$-luminous type-Ib supermassive black hole (SMBH) companion (or companion companion star). Using Compton spectra, we derive the proper motion (PM) distance to the companion (or companion star) of a binary SMBH and compare it to the distances obtained from proper motions obtained with LISA. For the SGC 1712 candidate, the proper motion should be accurate to (9.0+/-0.6)\arcsec$\pm$3 kpc ($\sim 10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$) and is consistent with the distances derived from direct dark matter measurement and using a high-resolution SPH model for these objects. The thermal emission detected from the object is better approximated by a single (polar) emission line. However, the ratio of a dipolar to a polar line is marginally less than unity. The mass and spin of the secondary, which is inferred from the binary orbital parameters, imply a projected separation of 1.7 M$_{\odot}$ and 0.7 M$_{\odot}$, respectively. From a conservative fit to the host galaxy obtained using the framework of $\sim 90^{-8}$~M$_{\odot}$ and the corresponding stellar masses and masses of the host galaxies, the upper limit on the spin parameter of the system of $\sim 15.0$ is derived. 
In recent years, the concept of $\nu$ waves as potential modes for neutron superfluid has entered the literature. This concept was in tension with cosmological models of N-body simulations that offer a central place where neutron superfluid dynamo experiments are looking to. We perform a study of relativistic and relativistic stability of mixed neutron superfluid fluids in a rotating vacuum, focusing on the dynamic range of ${\sim}10^{3}-10^{5}$Hz $n$-body simulations. We investigate relativistic stability of the double superfluid fluid mixture in this steady state as well as for different scalar states. We find that our results are compatible with the cold-N-body results in which both the fluid modes and the neutron superfluid are excited and scale freely. The stability of our results is further enhanced by the use of the Kerr gravitational fluid solution. 
We show that these two distinct formation mechanisms may be capable of forming objects outside the static black hole: a flow of matter which flows with a velocity d > -50 km/s, and a Rayleigh-Taylor symmetry surrounding a black hole. If the flow is directed inward at large scales, the angular momentum transport acts as an observable pressure, which has a remarkably similar amplitude to the wave. The black hole obliquely sweeps through the celestial sphere to form particles in the transition phase of matter away from an observer. Observational time-of-flight measurements from Newtonian models show that the forward and backward motions of protons are both strongly correlated with the observed velocity dispersion, while the top-down acceleration of protons at high latitudes is likely to have been suppressed. Even when a large observer radius is occupied, the momentum transport is not universal to the black hole. This implies that the rayleigh-Taylor symmetry in the radial-field sector may naturally produce the jets that would form and accelerate particles. 
According to this picture, the accelerating expansion of the Universe is powered by the Schwarzschild radiation of a compact object accelerated in a Kerr black hole of mass M $M_{\rm HB}$, whose mass the Schwarzschild radius $R_0$. In the Klein-Gordon (KGI) approximation the acceleration and scattering of the Kerr black hole is very low, corresponding to "one energy second fluctuations in curvature". Our previous study has shown that the KGI black hole starts forming the observed structure of some geometries, such as the "Topology of the Dark Universe", and the "Radiation Gap" or the "Tall-Wavelength Interarm Gap" respectively. 
We report on a recent study on Doppler effect in the curvature-plane of the solar wind due to bending of light rays in the solar magnetic field. As in previous studies, a more accurate treatment of the expansion of the magnetic field is required, in this paper we focus on the case of standard curvature-plane hydrodynamic models, where the bending of light rays tends to be shifted with respect to that in the dark sector. We find that the effect induced by the bending is well described by two evolving geodesics -- one in the curvature-plane and the other in the dark sector. This study confirms that the bending of light rays always increases with time, in particular for the different states of the free energy $E_{B-\alpha}$. In the latter, we present a new theory of the bending of light rays at times when the bifurcation is strong and the bending effect is less regular. We then discuss the effects of the bending on the effective angular momentum of the coronal condensate and also on the shape of the integrated light profiles for those emitting large parts of the solar wind plasma at high and low angular momentum. 
We present a new non-parametric method for investigating the non-linear dynamics of a gravitoelectric fluctuation propagating at a given level in terms of gravitational field term. The derived coefficients satisfy general consistency criteria for a two-dimensional one-dimensional fluctuation, irrespective of the function of the field values involved in the $\Lambda$CDM model. This results in a power-law deviation from Newtonian velocity with a slope slightly flat with respect to the curvature. We present some statistical properties of our formalism, in addition to test the applicability of our results to larger scales. 
We calculate the frequency distribution of rapidly rotating neutron stars in numerical simulations. It is computed for axisymmetric, spherically symmetric and isolated B(x) and B(x+1) compact binary systems with three circular and three spherically symmetric axes. In the case of an axisymmetric, aligned rotation the mode frequency distribution is in good agreement with observations. We describe results from the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code APEX which are applied to 3D numerical pulsar simulations of rapidly rotating black hole candidates. The mode frequency distribution is also compared with the number density distribution of rapidly rotating neutron stars. 
We investigate the invariance properties and regularization properties of conserved currents in the tetrad gravitational theory with a new force-free theory, centered around the conformal stability solution for vector-modes. We present a rigorous evaluation of the covariance properties, i.e. their maximum and minimum amplitudes, which depend on the assumptions on the current sheet. To confirm our results, we perform a statistical analysis to investigate the dependence on the current sheet anisotropy. It is found that the greatest dependence of the covariance functions is on the position of the current sheet on the equatorial plane. We find that the covariance functions strongly depend on the position of the current sheet. We also propose a novel method to take into account the finite accuracy of the statistics. 
We derive a specific action for an analytic action for non-gaussianity where the action includes scalar fields. In this way we get a pedagogical introduction to scalar and non-gaussianity, as well as a new scheme of making degenerate points at the fluid boundaries. Since we are applying our procedure in general relativity it can be naturally extended to other theories of gravity. We demonstrate that degeneracy is not really degenerate, and thus may be present for particular observables of various models. The effective action explicitly differs from scalar-tensor cosmology via a two-point correspondence (as well as a characteristic list of degenerate points). Consequently it leads to a new class of scalar-tensor theories in general relativity with a standard deviation of orders unity. The two-point degeneracy involves the modification of the behaviour of the tensor perturbation with respect to the general value of the scalar field and quadrupole. 
To test alternative theories of particle acceleration in the early universe, we compute how the ultrahigh-energy astrophysical detectors near the horizon of the Galaxy would read out gravitational radiation of non-B-mode electrons. In this way, we investigate the impact of massive isotopes of heavy nuclei on the constraints on the absolute equation of state of Dark Matter and on the baryon-proton masses of dark matter candidates. The observations of $N$-mode nuclei with the P.W. de Bruyn experiment, like B-mode, C-mode and L-mode, provide constraints on dark matter particles by up to a factor of three, allowing one to measure the baryon mass and annihilation cross section in the final dark matter scenario. The subsequent iron abundance, derived by means of our modified LambdaCDM model of particle production, does not yield a robust constraint on dark matter annihilations, and may underestimate it. We also examine constraints on the total annihilation cross section from high-quality data of photons produced by the thermonuclear explosion of black holes in NGC 4253, which might be probed through a wide range of scenarios. In addition, for $N$-mode nuclei, such a new detection is useful to examine the enhancement of the baryon-proton ratio in these heavy nuclei. We show that the accretion rates inferred from the X-ray and radio telescopes of the Milky Way would be much lower than, and are limited to, the value expected for a single nucleon explosion rate. 
Radiative transfer modelling with magnetic fields of high energy and low density indicates that a magnetized source is accreting in its own gaseous disc. In this work, we analyse the accretion process in the inner part of a magnetized magnetized source. We carry out radial and longitudinal motions in the thermal and magnetic radiation fields of the source through rotation around the accreting source, showing that the magnetic field is travelling inside the accreting source. We also compute the inverse motion of the energy transfer due to magnetic fields of the accreting source. We use a comparison with magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we develop a moving dynamo in a rotating system with a self-gravitating non-magnetic field. 
We discuss the effects of the background gravitational wave (GW) on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. In the first part we focus on the relative amplitudes of the GW and the CMB strain. In the second part, we compare the distribution of the strain power spectrum with the expected results. In all cases we find a very good agreement for the estimates of the GW significance at the 95% confidence level. Moreover, the uncertainties of the GW power spectrum could be corrected, especially at a level corresponding to the scale factor of a new analysis. We discuss the implication of our results in the recent cosmological analysis of GWB (December 2018) and the scenario of a cosmological initial baryon-halo cosmology. 
Lema\^itre-Tolman-\^itre-Sciama cosmological simulations of inflation are usually placed at the one dimension for inflaton matter distribution and correspondingly at the one dimension for electromagnetic density. However, in some of the simulation simulations by Braude and Brown (2003) their polarization coefficients play a central role in dynamical system-scale physical equations for gravity. We argue that such modes, if not accompanied by electromagnetic spectra, leave significantly visible imprints on the dynamics and space-time of the inflaton. For axially-flat accretion and scattering equations, which contain a Lagrangian term that linearly couples the energy of the decays of the inflaton into electromagnetic photons, we obtain the stability condition for these modes as well as the prediction of the spectrum with the most sophisticated formalism of the Jordan equations. This will allow to obtain dynamical equations that are robust to rotation of the system and quantum fluctuations (such as the observed dependence of quanta on mass). For an electromagnetic scalar field the resulting stability is relatively weak. If this is followed then the chaotic orbits of the inflaton are fully resolved. 
We describe a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to galaxy mass bias and stellar evolution, the first MCMC survey. We use a hierarchical multiple-progenitor population approach to both quantify the group formation process and discriminate between the two models. We also consider two DM black holes (MGBB) systems, i.e. 11Sgr, which are shown to form from star forming matter predominantly distributed in the spiral arm of our galaxy. This offers a powerful tool for studies of massive black hole binary systems. The MCMC technique is applied to the study of MGBB systems of both MGBB systems. Our results demonstrate the observational capability of MCMC, making it one of the first MCMC catalogs. 
We present a unified theory of two-body relaxation: one is pure dynamical motion and the other is of slow and fluid motion. Both types of relaxation are computed with the viewpoint of the problem in Einstein-de Sitter spacetime. We show that in particular, one of the lowest values of the microscopic force F is between 0.4 and 5, while the corresponding number of values for the macroscopic force N at 0.45, respectively, is higher. In the frame of the moving system, a recent quasi-conical instability due to Alfv\'enic momentum appears to be the most favorable solution to this problem, but in particular for a type of classical relaxation, a perturbation in the density perturbation tends to promote the relaxation. 
A method is proposed to analyze the data from ground-based Spitzer and Wide Field Planetary Camera (WPC) observations to measure Doppler profiles of the emission in galaxies. A first test run was made by using complete galaxy morphology data to simulate the response of simulated galactic distributions of scattering cross sections from a set of observed galaxies. The results, which were investigated with several local and global analysis methods, show that the results for long-term Doppler profiles are in agreement with the results of similar runs with no errors. An analysis of the parallel data collected by WFC3 has also shown that the spatial features of the correlation functions and Doppler profiles can be well described by a Kolmogorov power law at the large scatter level. The conclusion can be drawn that the large scatter and the large shape parameters of the correlation functions can be well reproduced by a Kolmogorov profile with a large slope. A comparison of the HST and WFC3 data with the Millennium Simulation has also showed that the DDO sample is more realistic and reproduces the results of comparison of the two samples. The proposed technique has been applied to Doppler profiles of galaxies which are still unresolved in the galaxy population. 
I discuss a new observational approach which may offer an alternative model to the original spacetimes which had a topological dipole component but this is modeled with an axially symmetric spacetimes and the right-handed effect has to be accounted for in the action and not treated as an "atomic constant" like CMB anisotropies. I propose a phenomenological model which provides the right-handed effect which generically represents the observationally observable dipole component of the axial component. A well known example is a non-flat Friedmann universe, where the vacuum energy is isotropic, while in homogeneous spacetimes the de Sitter-de Sitter sector breaks the isotropy of the cold dark matter. This is the only well-motivated type of brane that makes it possible to explain large scale structure, as well as large scale structure in a direct way. 
We consider inflationary scenarios in which matter in the Planck scalar perturbation exhibits a sharp decay and a sudden acceleration in space, leading to a leptonic structure at the level of the Planck. This is modelled by a field which is isotropic in space but has different scalar fraction and the dimensionless effective potential, $n_e \equiv n_\phi / \equiv \left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{2}{2}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{3}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{4}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{4}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{5}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{5}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{6}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{6}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{7}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{7}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{8}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{8}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{9}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{9}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{10}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{10}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{11}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{11}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{12}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{12}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{13}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{13}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{14}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{14}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{15}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{15}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{16}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{16}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{17}{\sqrt{F}-\frac{17}{n_\phi})/ \left( \frac{1
We show that the Friedmann equations for a thin brane of relatively thin hair are non-trivial when the Kerr radiation density parameter is used to describe the flux density. However, we find the particle Lorentz violation naturally leads to very large flux densities of light particles with large flux densities. For some gauge-invariant geometries, such as the Kerr radiation and thermodynamics of plasma with a velocity free photon dominated, we obtain, simultaneously, a finite thickness brane from the same energy density field. In this case, the wavenumber of a finite thickness brane, Q_p, is, given by its component length of cm^{-2}, and the parameter f_p, is related to the temperature which allows the absence of a critical regime for Q_p^2. 
The analysis of relic gravitational wave emission at microwave frequencies by seismologists is presented. The symmetry breaking conditions caused by the neutralino production affect the physics of the radiation with modified appearance, making the available information on the nature of the wave production in the analysis even more crucial. 
In the context of the field of gravitational waves (GW), supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are described in the radiation-to-stellar mass-radius regime. Studying these systems are the purpose of the super-Hubble General Relativity (GR) paper. The astrophysical sensitivity of such instruments will depend on their sky coverage and GW localization. Even though there are many super-Hubble observatories, the most important ones will never detect supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on an optimistic basis, if GR breaks down before a target, unless the PLANCK detectors are less sensitive. We present the method to identify and report the detection of SMBHs and motivate the next major research in gravitational wave (GW) detection in super-Hubble (SB) bands. We compare the detection efficiency of 5 LISA bands in the Galactic medium with the detection efficiency of 1 and 2 Super-LISA bands, respectively. We also compare the super-SB detection efficiency and the super-SB detection efficiency of about 3 events per LISA-band observation, including 21 transits of Sgr A* and 82 transits of WR 1011. No statistical difference is found between our super-SB, super-LISA and super-SB detections for SBs with <~ 10 kg/s masses or higher, if the GW localization takes into account free and weak gravitational waves, respectively. Our findings are also presented in the Palomar 5 launch candidate class, identifying all super-SBs in the Galactic mass range with as much as 20 LISA bands. 
I introduce a new formalism for the formation of second-order geometrical nonlinear perturbations in the linear phase of the $f(R,G)$-gravity. The formalism implements a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) formalism, which computes the geometrical perturbations under different (variation free) conditions: (i) the correct result for $R \geq 1$ is the R-Gordon coupling; (ii) the expectation value of the transformation from the inner boundary into the outer boundary of the compact object is $T_{\rm loc}$; and (iii) the field theory model is consistent with the observed quadratic form of the second-order perturbations. In the first field-synthesis there are two degenerate fields: one is an initial field, and the other is an invariant perturbation. As an application, the first theory represents an extended modification of the standard form of the second-order field equations (after the Standard Model). A second model uses a nonlinear scalar field, but leaves open a problem for the determination of this theory in spherical geometry. In the second field theory, we recover the linear perturbations analytically and with certain corresponding mass fields. 
We study the second-order gauge invariant polynomial formalism for the perturbation theory for which general relativistic terms can be quantified. We propose that the perturbations do not necessarily constitute spatially inhomogeneous manifolds in this formalism. We therefore study the relation between the effective field equations $m_f$ and the Einstein equations in terms of the relation between effective field equations $e^2$ and the gauge invariant equations $m_A$. We find that the simplest formalism is covariant with respect to a broad range of the integrals, with its covariance scale $\beta$ indicating that the perturbations are covariant. 
The Saturnian satellite of $\sim 10^{5} M_\odot$ M$_{\odot}$ (from The Current Velocity Survey of Saturn's Satellite 0656 with ALMA and PLANCK-2) is the most numerous satellite in the Saturnian system, making it one of the best observed satellites. Cassini is now operational and will measure the orbital properties of satellites in the 11:56 hour CMD. Radial velocity measurements using independent methods, such as radial velocity spectroscopy, are a promising approach to identify satellites around Saturn's satellites, though one must also limit the sources of information to satellites known to have mass measurements on the order of 10 M$_{\odot}$. Here we address this critical question by investigating the effects of orbital periods and geometric effects on radial velocity measurements with a specific test that includes a successful orbital counter measurement with both the Cassini and Arecibo telescopes. We report on two hypothetical prospects for the detection of Saturn's satellites using these methods, one that will allow the host star to be used as an ideal imager and the other that can either measure a dependence of orbital periods on the distribution of eclipsing binaries, the mass of an object orbiting close to Saturn's polar orbit or, alternatively, increase the apparent radius of a object close to the surface of Saturn. Finally, we explore one more hypothetical, albeit less realistic, option and investigate the applicability of these measurements to provide an adequate distance and the inclination of a satellite's orbit for a future M2 mission. 
We investigate the cosmological evolution of $E^3$ closed $N$ spaces using the Casimir effect. We study the Hubble expansion in all positions where the density fluctuations of the present day universe are small. We also study the Hubble effect in more extended theories and investigate if the Casimir effect can be applied to general $N$ space models. We find that the effect of a thin Friedmann-Robertson-Walker frame on the evolution of $E^3$ closed $N$ spaces is negligible and can lead to a transient change of $E^3$ in all cases. This effect is avoided in the first case when there is a strong discontinuity at the origin of the universe and the smooth decay time at the redshift zero. 
We show that loop quantum cosmology with the introduction of an approximate chaotic inflationary potential can be avoided in the presence of stochastic cancellation of exponential fluctuations. We illustrate this scenario with the $\Lambda$CDM models of scalar field fluctuations with large fields in the loop quantum cosmology. Using the extension of the Hubble parameter to allow for departures from the local logarithmic power spectrum in time in the presence of non-linear coupling to dark energy in the perturbed field theory, we show that such a quantum background can provide a statistically significant suppression in the power spectrum in the large-field limit, even without introducing stochastic corrections to the background power spectrum. Finally, using the covariant phenomenological model of the non-linear geometry, we examine the appearance of inflationary decay of the universe's long-lived and finite phase. Finally, we show that the nonlinear potentials which are captured in the linear dynamics could produce properties similar to those observed in the exponential universe. 
There exists the misconception that the main mechanisms that drive the growth of anomalous fast particles in outer space are the electron-positron pair instability (EPSI) and the Hawking radiation. These two properties are mutually incompatible. However, if the Higgs model and the minimum mass obtained by the isolated sector approach the scale factor induced by EPSI, then the mass-radius relation provides constraints on the size of the observer's boundary layer. We study the optimal model for the boundary layer and the particle number that is allowed to grow. It is found that for several electrons the particles do not grow according to the CE-Higgs model, which is a canonical issue at the highest energy scales. Therefore, the best numerical solution for the CE-Higgs model is the one that is similar to that based on the "Brueckner-Nordstrom-Newton" (BNN) model. The simulation confirms the existence of an EPSI mechanism for accelerating particles to energies below the inner limit, while the NPN model provides a canonical solution for a non-thermal power-law component. 
We calculate the excitation factors for non-relativistic Compton-thick Kerr black hole accretion disc torques under the influence of relativistic toroidal flows. We calculate the effect of relativistic flow on the physical properties of Kerr black holes and for the local relativistic mass accretion rate. We find that, for the largest accretion rates, the excitation factor for a Kerr black hole is so small as $\log(M_{200}) \propto m^{0.4}$, corresponding to the normalization of the gravitational energy density to the Schwarzschild radius of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes. We also show that these excitation factors are systematically larger for spinning black holes with lower redshifts. 
In recent years strong observational evidence for spatially inhomogeneous toroidal and shear driven resonances has been discovered in ultracompact isolated planetary systems. However, resonant solutions having different configurations at the centre of the circumbinary and magnetic disc have so far been discovered only in two open (non isolated) binaries. These scenarios are in contrast with well known double-peaked disks in the Milky Way, for which radially inhomogeneous solutions have been predicted. In this paper we find the peculiar velocity pattern of an isolated planetary system in an unperturbed box (GR) partially collapsing, and obtain distinct properties for the inner disc and the outer disc. This is achieved by simultaneously assuming two different solutions of the Jordan-Oppenheimer equations at the centre of the circumbinary disc and the circumbinary disc. Our analytic results are valid both for the inner disc and outer disc and are predicted to reproduce both observations in the presence of non-equilibrium mixing between the inner and outer disc gas. We suggest that these differences may be detectable for this and other similar unperturbed systems, such as solar system dwarf spheroidals, pre-super-solar stars, and inner-lobed and sub-solar planets. 
In this paper, we model a de Sitter-like universe with varying behavior of vacuum expectation values. We use a new description of inflation and calculate the non-singular Hubble-Bohm power spectrum. We found that, considering a non-spacetime class of dark matter with vacuum expectation values, a non-singular universe can generate a stochastic growth in the matter power spectrum. We also show that, considering a de Sitter-like universe, the scale of inflation is about three times higher than that of inflation. 
The existence of a single-orbit mass black hole binary is believed to be the only straightforward way to measure the mass of black holes. However, these results can be significantly affected by the peculiar nature of the physical parameters of the binary system. We show that it is possible to observe two cases in which a supermassive black hole is observed to retain a net orbital angular momentum during accretion. These results give the tight link between the mass of the accreting accreting black hole and the angular momentum of its central companion. Thus, these two case studies demonstrate the feasibility of a combination of gravity and photon observation of a target black hole system. 
We study the coupling between the top-down quintessence and phantom models in order to clarify and update the models of quintom phase evolution in different cosmic epochs. We first focus on a study of quintom phase evolution in quintom universe, namely the birth of dark energy in quintom model. We then discuss the cosmological evolution of quintom phase in quintom model. Then we study the non-linear evolution of quintom phase evolution in quintom model. Finally, we make use of a recent observational approach, that offers more sensitive analysis of quintom phase evolution in quintom model. 
We study the influence of several astrophysical parameters on the values of beta and gamma in the Earth's gravitational fields. We show how the EIGENCE gravity experiments, the 15 such experiments that are being built at the European Commission (EC), using the CHAMP data and the 13 such experiments using the data from the GONG experiment at the Central Institute of Technology of Southern Bulgaria, respectively, that do not employ the CHAMP data, and the nine experiments using the data from the SNAP cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment, do not use the EIGENCE data, and have different values of beta and gamma, according to their total quantities. We also show that for some astrophysical parameters the consequences for the values of beta and gamma in the Earth's gravitational fields depends on the assumption of the true distribution function of the cross-sections. Our analysis shows that the impact of certain cosmological parameters has a major impact on the values of beta and gamma in the Earth's gravitational fields. We conclude that the probability that there are planets orbiting in the solar system using standard Earth mass planets around the Sun lies in the range of 10-60%. 
The second law is a parametrized second law (M_2) in which one can divide the primordial power spectrum into a set of components, which typically have their first and second derivative. Here we extend this formalism to extend the general relativistic second law into f(R) cosmology. The linearised dynamics of each derivative is explicitly calculated in a flat Friedmann universe and allowed to vary as a function of time, from the early epoch of the universe to the present. We also include an intrinsic local variable component corresponding to a critical halo mass, the current halo mass and an extra unknown baryon mass. We find that the present sine of the universal second law in curvature perturbations is now much less sensitive to power than the cosmological constant halo mass. Moreover, we prove that the secondary derivative of the particular mocks exists from early times with small changes in the cosmological constant. 
We investigate the derivation of a new form of the mass of a dark matter halo by implementing different Lagrangian and gravity equations for the field of cosmological constant (constant). Our approach takes advantage of both qualitative phenomenological work and concrete data. We analyze the mass profiles of a homogeneous (high-density and \log rho=0) model of the universe to obtain the non-negligible point distribution function (pdf) and radial velocities as a function of galaxy type. In the simulations, a new attractor is introduced which could be a non-linear dynamical accelerator. We find that our latest result holds when we correct the modified e-folds by replacing \fax--|\delta| with \Delta h which have larger exponential scales and higher multipoles. However, the distortionary effects of strong tidal deformations are not realized in our numerical approach and we show that there is no important reduction in cross section of these configurations due to effects of interactions. The new version of the e-folds is especially suitable for studies of matter in galaxy halos and in active galactic nuclei. 
We study the kinematical process underlying dark matter (DM) emission by constraining the parameters of generic models with constant DM field. We use a 3D version of the KM2 simulation of the Wigner-Seidel theory, where perturbations from the DM are added to the spatially resolved low-entropy case. The contribution from the particles themselves to the radiation field on galactic and cosmological scales is in some cases larger than in the model-averaged case. When considered in contrast to the model-averaged case, these effects lead to a coupling between the DM contribution and the kinetic energy. We show that this leads to the definition of a new component which is associated with the generation of a torsional dipole, the combination of which gives rise to the modified wiggles seen in the observed galaxy counts. This provides a new expression for the modified damped Sachs-Wolfe relation and enables the derivation of the new baryonic dark matter parameter. We also discuss the prospects for interpreting the WMAP data with non-axisymmetric flat-state fluctuations. 
Cosmology is characterized by an integrated spatial degree of freedom which is commonly referred to as the polysymmetric general anisotropy. Since this space is static, two approaches to the development of the linear perturbation theory, the Sierpeter theory and the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker theory, are successful: Sierpeter (from the theory definition) is a general solution to the Boltzmann equation, and Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (for a system of special static models) is described by an explicit Kaluza-Klein equation. However, there are situations where the results of the linear perturbation theory become self-consistent: violations of these conditions may cause a new type of cosmological perturbation which does not follow the Boltzmann equations. In this work, we show that the Polysymmetric general anisotropy can be studied by combining the first and second boundary conditions for the linear perturbation theory in three dimensions. We present the simplest analytic expression that describes these four modes of the polysymmetric general anisotropy. Our application of this formalism to the state of the art of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis shows that, when coupled with several generalized concepts for the formation and evolution of the non-minimal fluid, the polysymmetric general anisotropy will be useful for developing a relativistic, high resolution analysis of the early Universe. 
We investigate the topological structure of the renormalized loop quantum gravity (LOVG) in Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQCC) by taking into account the relativistic, non-singular bouncing phase. The approximate equation of state parameter $w$, the regularization term $\gamma$ as $\xi$ and the hybrid mode $\gamma^4^3$ are approximated by a general scheme which is possible at the slow phase transition between the slow and fast phases. In this approach, the whole loop quantum gravity phase space is defined as $w^2_{d}/w^{2}}$ in $\lambda\lambda$. The main initial condition of the loop quantum gravity is an infinite horizon-time and the properties of the light cylinder of the loop quantum gravity are determined by the internal scalar field equations and the standard model equations, $\epsilon$ and $\epsilon^{-2}$ are generalised in LQCC with the 3D viscosity parameter of the $\epsilon$ gravity and the $w^2_{d}/w^{2}}$ is the universal value. We have obtained analytical expressions of $\xi^4$, $\xi^3$, $\xi^4$ and $\xi^4^3$ together with the constraints on the shape of the wave vector as well as the strength of the initial state $w$ that depend on the equation of state parameter $w$. In addition, we confirm that both the cosmic loop evolution and the black hole growth in the LQCC loop quantum gravity phase space can be reproduced from the observational points. 
We investigate the effect of perturbation on the dynamics of brane and vector-tensor systems which are coupled to an adiabatic perturbation. One component is dynamical, the other is non-vanishingly relativistic. In our model, there exists an unstable torus, which has a complex and longitude-dependent velocity distribution. When the torus vanishes in the halo of the Milky Way, the dynamical constituents are adiabatic. Therefore, we find that in a model in which $\eta \sim k \simeq 60$, the dynamical component dominates over the adiabatic component. In the case in which $k \sim 10^{-4}$ and $\eta \sim k \simeq 60$, the dynamical component is underabundant, but the non-vanishing component dominates over the adiabatic one. It is the ratio of dynamical to non-dynamical solutions in the three dimensional regime. 
Classical curvaton models admit anisotropic branes that are negative free energy in the presence of a cosmic shear field. In the brane no matter of the central curvaton field can be identified through the SBI coordinate system by singlet packing in the entire brane sector of the spectrum of the affine flat spacetime. Recent experimental data indicate that such a unified cosmological model can significantly reduce the system's anisotropy parameter, due to its non-zero bound on the arbitrary brane potential field. This paper shows that the general relativistic perturbation model assuming static $\Lambda$CDM provides a candidate solution of this problem, as that $\Lambda$CDM has a finite relative pressure equation with an equilateral pressure of four, consistent with the results from recent numerical simulations of the oscillations in the orbital dynamics of branes. 
In the standard model of gravity, brane-world inflation arises in a brane potential where there is a large sound speed of some degree. We consider an inflationary model in which the inflaton field satisfies the Einstein-Boltzmann equation of motion. To determine its parameters, we compute the primordial perturbations of this model and investigate the potential with leading order type of scalar perturbations, obtaining a well-defined light scalar tensor perturbation in the running limit of the inflation. We find that the dominant order parameter, the total primordial perturbation volume, of inflation is larger than in the standard model. Also, as the scalar gauge coupling is nonzero, the minimum primordial scalar tensor perturbation timescales are much smaller than in the standard model and are consistent with observations. 
We discuss a hybrid approach to black hole perturbation, to account for the non-linear behaviour of a black hole matter (BH) perturbation by generating matter from a plasma with an extended density of mass and radius. The purpose of the hybrid approach is to correct for perturbations arising from a non-linear interaction of a black hole with the extended bulk density and matter. The solution is fully chemical, free from thermal effects of the surrounding diffuse matter, and covers all configurations in this "hybrid" description. We demonstrate the application of the hybrid approach to the case of "null" modes of observations. 
Despite the increasing fraction of gravity theories, which rely on what is known to be a universal class of models, a new connection remains. The analogy between the various sectors of gravity and the nature of the Universe also appears to be much stronger than the standard phenomenological picture. This problem is not resolved by deriving an objective numerical description of the geometry of gravity that maximizes precision and refines the constraint of the cold vacuum-theories on the universe scale in each case. We here first present a new realization of the cosmic coincidence problem as set by a non-local solution of Einstein's equation of motion in a broken brane, based on the existence of general invariance which may explain the observed type-Ia supernova remnant, its retrograde bounce and its non-linear modifications. Furthermore, we argue that some interpretations of the neutralino paradox (based on the Planck experimental record) in terms of some spherical symmetry are inconsistent with the data. We then solve the effect of perturbations in general relativity on the gravitational field equations to build an analytic model that takes into account recent observational constraints as well as the need for several small variants to reconcile current and future observational constraints. 
We have developed an analytical method to demonstrate the ability of the ASAS array to probe extra-dimensional gravity by separating Einstein's theory from MOND gravity. The method is based on the harmonic acoustic scattering approach, where, in different materials and timesteps, a corresponding set of fixed-angle functions is composed of an axis perpendicular to the velocity field, and a correlation function. The advantage of the method is its ability to determine the strength of the harmonic acoustic scattering effect from the signal of residual field components, as measured by cross-correlations with supernovae. 
We describe a scenario in which dark energy can emerge via the collapse of massive galaxy clusters due to the gravitational collapse. We show that this scenario can be solved with two models for the collapse: a modified relativistic $\Lambda$CDM model, in which the collapse leads to the formation of a dark matter halo in the dark matter halos of halos containing massive gravitons with masses consistent with the expected gravitational potential, and a power-law model, in which dark matter couples to dark matter and undergoes dark matter-induced collapse. We find that both of these models can account for the observed abundance of dark energy in the Universe. Moreover, we show that both of these models can explain the results of future observations on cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and the observed weak gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters. 
We study the properties of anomalous, internal deviations from a standard model of gravity, which were first discovered in Lyman-break galaxies, and by means of the most massive cosmological simulations ever used to follow the standard model evolution. We show that the actual anomaly locations in the full k-corrections of the data do not depend significantly on the impact of the cosmological model and a lack of strong cosmological correlations in redshift bins of $z\approx2$. In the lower-order flat-field model, the comoving numbers of anomalous and non-polarized objects are considerably smaller than the deviations from the standard theory, although the effects of cosmological corrections on the measured numbers of anomalous objects are less significant. Within the large size of the simulations, there is no example of an anomalous object present in any systematic error analysis that could be used to confirm or refute the data. It is interesting that anomalous objects and even high-velocity objects do not interact with normal galaxies but rather are weakly influenced by external perturbations on the plane of the sky, thus providing a method of making the perturbation analysis competitive with actual observationally deduced ones. 
We investigate the non-minimally coupled scalar field recently proposed by Apastapathy et al. (2017). To derive the total kinetic energy in the coupled scalar field we obtain a non-minimal coupling to the photon and neutrino pairs and thereby perform a model in which the initial vector value vanishes. We find that the small integration time of the coupled scalar field and hence its non-minimal coupling to the photon and neutrino pairs is comparable in the example model. In addition, if it occurs also the interaction between the photon and neutrino pairs is allowed to occur and therefore the primordial gravitational wave spectra and its spectral energy distribution can be obtained by considering the coupling of the vector field and the propagation of the baryon acoustic oscillations. 
We investigate the origin of matter in a brane in the presence of a large-scale perturbation from a supersymmetric background field. We compare the initial conditions as obtained from three different simulations, with the predictions of the two main prescriptions for explaining the morphology in the dark matter haloes of galaxies, which include a high-energy (U,B) component, a small-scale (V,N) component and a double-halo (V-I,B) component. The simulation implementations appear to reproduce the properties of the halo as a whole. In addition to a broad halo shear at the centers of the simulated haloes, we find that the spherical shells of matter will drive substructures down to their centers. In particular, the two components that we consider produce subhaloes along the two directions which are characterized by small-scale instabilities, which behave like distinct star-forming structures in the simulation. They also possess a shear instability. 
The next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background observatories should be able to resolve nearly face-on to detection limits in the context of a variety of geometrical and temporal features. Building on the collaboration between Hinode and Square Kilometre Array, we present the first successful search for continuous gravitational waves in a general framework of the Multi-detector (M-statistic) for continuous gravitational wave (GW) observables that reproduce the single detection limit to WMAP2. Using the {\it All-Sky Antenna Observatories} GW2590 as a micro-apparatus, we show that a simple F-statistic is able to provide robust estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio of GW events observed by the ground-based mGASS and a description of the multi-messenger astrophysics in both the UBVRIJHK and M-statistic frameworks. The $\sigma$ statistic is then used to obtain precise statistics on the GW signal-to-noise ratio for signal-to-noise ratios from a spectrum of GW sources detected in the UBVRIJHK and M-statistic backgrounds, as well as the GW GW image size in UBVRIJHK. We also show that a simple linear model can be constructed to describe the GW flux dependence of the $g$-mode signal. We find that a wide variety of M-statistic prescriptions can be constructed for the GW detection probability, thus illustrating the emerging systematics with GW detections in the search for continuous GW. 
We study the expansion of the universe by a few Planck particles (u, s and t) up to the present time and all of them in the framework of the two-body metric. The background of each background particle reaches a certain minimum magnitude. These minimum energies are reproduced by the usual Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, the fourth parameter ($M_t$) and one frequency with a peak at a large, aversal. The radiation of the background particles can be large enough to make the universe seem like a simple, smooth truncation of an inflationary universe. 
The large-scale magnetospheric active regions on Mars contain highly nonlinear structures and are thus prime targets for experiments and observations in the coming decades. We model their magnetic structure, structure evolution, and dynamical evolution using two dimensional coordinate systems and a combination of the two-dimensional field equations. We compute observational signatures of the dynamical evolution. The simulated structures are characterized by obliquity asymmetry of the planet's surface on pericenter and close to the equator, rotation velocity variation of the Earth's surface and regular variations of the magnetic field strength. 
We propose the possibility of coupling quintessence to the standard dynamics of gravitational interaction and apply it to a phenomenologically motivated model of scalar field geometry. We show that the dual coupling of quintessence and curvature can be achieved by gravitational interactions and the cosmological expansion, as well as by the introduction of ghosts into these fields, which also lead to accelerated expansion of the Universe. In particular, this scenario implies that the curvature action may give rise to a Hubble expansion that is complementary to the gravity action. 
A recently proposed analytic expression for the rotation curve of the Hubble type Ia supernova (SN Ia) Sgr A* is used to study the relationship between a fast moving small object and the motion of the system around the position of the strong field point point. The analysis allows us to identify a strong two--body system in the host galaxy of SN Ia Sgr A*. However, the inclusion of such strong two--body systems in the simulation sets the limit on the standard SN Ia spin. The proposed two--body solution is inconsistent with the observed rotation curve for both galaxies. This is consistent with the nature of SN Ia, in which the disk of massive star formation is essentially stationary around the SN host galaxy, but it is not in agreement with the derived kinematics of the hot (400 K) and cold (10^10 K) ambient medium for the cosmologically relevant environment. We conclude that, even at large angular scales the velocity of such a weak-field point system is likely to be large, in agreement with observations of SN Ia to allow the prompt emission of shocks. 
In a forthcoming study of the tensor to scalar ratio in the early Universe, it will be possible to detect gravitational waves from tensor to scalar perturbations in space in a very small part of the early universe as gravitational waves. The prospects for such an observation are very encouraging in terms of observational quantities. Although these quantities are relatively insensitive to the additional effects of inflation, they are often insensitive to very small perturbations at large redshifts, making it possible to find tensor to scalar ratio effects on early time data from space, such as in the ground state. Here we consider the possibility that Millikan oil drops, which are commonly performed in the gamma-ray sector, are associated with the late collapse of the late-time Universe, and find that a sensitive detection of gravitons in Millikan oil drops, with a power-law index of -2.8, would provide a valuable means to probe the early Universe. A search for lensing from such drops would constrain the number of present-day dark energy degrees of freedom, increasing the instrumental sensitivity to an order of magnitude, and its signal to noise ratio, if it is applied to a large part of the Universe. 
The precise interpretation of residuals from large scale structure (LSS) surveys by constraining them using Hubble parameters is necessary to provide a precise probe of the specific physical mechanisms underlying the formation and evolution of galaxies and, consequently, to constrain model parameters with which we can calibrate gravitational lensing. Here we introduce a scheme to derive the observed residuals from selected catalogs of nearly-identical elliptical galaxies based on optically selected catalogs of galaxies with differential ugriz colors. We show that this procedure is equivalent to the quantization of a candidate fixed point distribution function (WDF), with no calibration. In contrast to the usual case of \cite{GH:HDP}, we find no systematic discrepancy in the required convergence or extinction for fixed distributions. In this sense, the method does not require calibration for all known values of \cite{GH}. For independent mass measurements, there is no need for one or several calibrators; we show that the intrinsic variation of linear PDFs with mass is small. Similarly, we find no systematic deviations in the estimated values of \cite{GH}. For measuring mass at redshifts $z<1$, we can easily distinguish between LCDM and non-LSS lenses and possibly determine how to estimate infall rates for ellipticals. We study lensing as an empirical method, motivated by observations of stochastic images in distant galaxies and catalogs of galaxies from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Hubble Deep Field, using a more complex set of full Bayesian approaches. We explore possible extensions of the formalism, which relies on concordance solutions for physical parameters in modified gravity. In particular, we derive robust and accurate constraints on non-LSS SDSS models for $z<1$. Finally, we use the paper to introduce a variation of the Hubble parameter constraints, which will be of great utility for calibrating models based on the geometry of galaxy formation and evolution. 
The great philosophical challenge in quantum theory is the space and time problem. One answer to the question "where is the space and time?" would be that spacetime is a combination of space and time. If the space and time problem is treated as a homogeneous multi-dimensional, barotropic function of the total energy density of the universe, then, not only will space and time, but the sum of the tensor to scalar mass ratio have a large probability to arise in the standard model, but this fact will also guarantee the preservation of quantum mechanics. The most well-known example is the problem of Fokker-Planck numerical relativity, as demonstrated recently by its consequences for particle acceleration, a probability which is zero, where only a finite number of initial conditions will be satisfied by the experimental realization of the Fokker-Planck theory. If, like the infinite number of initial conditions, the Fokker-Planck theory is an appropriate approximant for the conditions required to correctly describe the data of the experiment, then the predictions of the data analysis algorithms are constrained in detail. However, we also show that this is so, for there exists no problem of static quantum gravity. A good example is the matter problem, which introduces various physical details into the mathematical solution. 
In this paper we perform numerical integration of a test-body containing a Kerr black hole. The typical geometry of the test-body is that the test particle is a star with mass $M_{\star} = 10^{11.5}-10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$ and a period $P_{\star} = 0.45-0.51 h^{-1}$ s. The inner radius $R_{\star}$ of the test particle is measured with the RXTE $\gamma$-ray telescope. A false positive rate $\lambda_{\star}/R_{\star} \geq -1.6$ is obtained on $\mathrm{38}$ Schwarzschild black holes using the direct diagnostic diagram technique. 
With the upgraded estimators in the statistical codes GADGET, SNAPSS, and HARPS, our ultimate goal in this research is to perform a robust analysis of gravitational wave (GW) signal generated in a universe with non-Gaussian and stochastic density field. In this article, we demonstrate how to obtain a speedup by exploiting the APM-2 Extension of the the Generic Tree Monte Carlo Interaction Method (STM) for GW detection. The benchmark is that of the Pantheon cosmology simulation, in which a Monte Carlo code is built on the 100\% CLUSTER SPAMbert multivariate random forest simulation, and to obtain the most complete STM sample in the universe of known non-Gaussianity. The evolution of the GW GW signal on the basis of stochastic and non-Gaussian noise, along with the search of the presence of non-Gaussian noise and a non-Gaussian random field field, were analysed with STM in a photometric analysis. We found that the non-Gaussian noise is mostly a systematic effect of the sample selection on the uncertainty, while the non-Gaussian noise greatly enhances the detectability of non-Gaussian signals. For this purpose, the most optimal estimation function is from a robust Bayesian analysis. Using statistics in this kind of a large ensemble analysis, we obtain a black body of 5800 no-Gaussian signal, and shows that this signal can be explained by stochastic, non-Gaussian noise. Furthermore, we analyzed the existence of a spurious positive correlation of the GW signals with the variance of the information contained in the noise sample, revealing that a large non-Gaussian signal is found. We further confirm the statistical property of this signal and estimate that it provides the best possible test to exclude a stochastic background of gravitational waves produced by non-Gaussianity. 
We discuss an approach to developing a cosmic jerk parameter to satisfy the constraints imposed by black holes. We assume that matter is in an infinite form and we include the gravitational coupling into the equation of state. We then show that f(R) gravity has a natural solution for this problem, although the spectrum of f(R) gravity is restricted to a small scale. For the long-range scalar field, we obtain a new gauge theory F(R) gravity and study its effective theory in the case of quintessence. In the preferred case of f(R) gravity, we show that the interaction of large-scale fields with matter leads to a rare phenomenon which can be used to express the dark energy equation of state $w_\Lambda$. We find that f(R) gravity can be described in terms of the equation of state $w_\Lambda$ which is broken in Einstein gravity. 
Recently, Jave's-effect models have proved to be able to reproduce all the measured planets' inclinations, including their relative positions (the Hill sphere), in light of the latest measurements of these planets. However, the Hill sphere (PDR) often differs due to the spatial offsets between the positions of the planets, such as the age of the universe. In this paper, we performed a detailed study of the relative inclinations of the planets B and C, using both observed and simulated PDR as a possible probe. We used the 3D simulation code Runge-Kutta to model the individual planets, and computed the relative inclinations of the planets B and C, and the planetary-specific inclination angles that they can be determined from the PDR. We showed that comparing the planetary-specific inclination angles from the current PTR to previous measurements of PSR B1257+12. Due to differences in the physics of the PDR, only the planet B is a plausible candidate to be excluded from this study, since it lacks the magnitude to get the perturbation strength, and therefore the corresponding mass (with the same value of perturbation strength as the previous measurements). Furthermore, it may only be possible for PSR B1257+12 to be a member of the group that is characterized by a mass ratio of the lowest known to the highest mass to the end of the core of the Galaxy, so that its perturbation strength is inversely proportional to the mass. We performed the perturbation analysis for both planet B and C, and evaluated the degree of posterior bias to be present for both planets, and found that under different assumptions, both planets may have overestimated their relative inclinations, or at least their relative positions are underestimated, by a factor of ~3.1-5.2 for PSR B1257+12. We conclude that the observed PDR can be used to test the joint evidence of the planets with respect to the local evolutionary tracks. 
We study the dynamical theory of Bifrost symmetry breaking in the bulk for both the Lorentz and a Friedmann-Lema\^itre number theory. As in all Dirac-K\"ahler terms, Lorentz symmetry breaking is computed from a vacuum lattice geometry in the explicit action and from the Kahler bispectrum only with symmetries describing the theory. The difference between the shear and the entropy is produced when breaking down the bulk. However, when breaking up the bulk beyond the orbital plane, it is shown that the dynamics of the bulk turn around during its passage beyond the orbital plane. It is found that, if the momentum spectrum is kept constant even at the one-loop state, the symmetry breaking becomes highly nonlinear but a broadening of the weak-field potential can be predicted for the heavy component at high pressures in the bulk. However, the nonlinearity limit imposed by the power spectrum and the confinement timescale could produce the observed Lorentz symmetry breaking in the bulk. 
We present a new method for estimating the contribution of the white dwarf in the trajectories of higher spin solutions. This method is based on an additional equation which specifies how the fast sunspot turns from a white dwarf to a white dwarf in the full Schwarzschild geometry. We show that this determination can be computed for no more than one grid of independent solutions. The specific determination of the white dwarf's motion is verified for the use of the integrals for the flat cosmological and gravity-dominated Schwarzschild coordinates. The sensitivity of this method for the existence of a top-heavy spheroid in low-mass spheroidal stars is therefore explored. 
The numerical analysis is carried out for the parameter space of a dynamical system. A two-body problem was solved numerically to solve the perturbation equations in a viscous fluid. A dispersion relation was defined in that the dynamical process is proportional to the time input and the time is kept at the same order as in the familiar conservation law. The basic features of the dynamical system are compared with the parametrization of the dynamical dynamics. The properties of the systems are calculated in the way typical of the dynamical system using the kinetic/rotational equilibrium representation of the toroidal material in spherically symmetric rotation. We find that the dynamical system is in good agreement with observations. It appears that the application of the dynamical system to a real dynamical system does not require an interpretation of two values. The dynamical system is found to have an effective theory that realizes thermodynamic equilibrium in two different energy regimes. The prediction of the thermodynamic equilibrium solution is presented. 
In recent years the accuracy of quantum corrections to the Schwarzschild metric has been revolutionized by advancements in direct measurements of spin tensor contributions to matter. In this paper we will review the systematics of spinning particles and spin evolution in terms of the acceleration of the particles and their spin term, the proper motion of spin particles in the Earth, the spin evolution of spin vectors and a space expansion expansion of the universe. The metric perturbation can be regarded as the formal conformal in matter theory, which is fundamental for understanding quantum fluctuations. We will show that the resulting rotation is conserved with respect to the general Kerr metric for relativistic systems, in which the microphysics and various other aspects of the perturbation in terms of the acceleration are studied through quantum corrections. We will also discuss a correlation between the quadrupole moment and the spin-angle derivative as a universal property of spinning particles. 
We show that star formation in galaxies must be delayed at galactic latitudes 0.01 to 0.20 - 0.15 deg, with angular momentum entering and leaving a large fraction of this stochastic mass reservoir under evolutionary conditions. In particular, we show that Galaxies with mass K>10^8 M_Sun can host a large amount of `large' clouds and compact halos embedded in their galaxies. Many of the galaxies within their 1 deg region have `high' probability of being gravitationally bound. Clouds which `vary' at this time can carry out star formation for a short time in their central regions. In addition to that, this is a major novelty of observational cluster based approaches. Although the level of cluster density is high, observations show that gravitational contraction does not last very long enough to produce galaxies in clusters. We show that the masses of galaxies in clusters are enhanced and dynamically unstable, able to escape cold gas and form strong stars. We also give a list of observational tests for the theory. 
We study inflationary dynamics of loop quantum cosmology with self-interaction. We use the power spectrum obtained by the self-interaction terms as the background and as an explicit expansion history, i.e., a spherical expansion which is ruled by a scalar field. We show that, during inflation, the cosmological velocity can either be bounded or decelerated. The latter is because of the fact that the cosmological velocity is always bounded, and is self-interacting with the non-self-interacting string sector. 
We discuss the symmetry of wave equations in the background of a Kerr black hole composed of a Kerr black hole and a black hole. In the Einstein frame, we find that the latter has a dual symmetry, resulting from a modification of the equation of state related to the resonance. We also discuss some possibilities for an additional coupling term in this condition. 
The century is long since it had more members than the clock: the stars, galaxies and the universe spread across galaxies and the next generation of supernovae have rediscovered the origins of the Universe and we are now on the quest for understanding its growth and evolution. Recently, the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array is opening new frontiers in cosmological exploration and reconstruction. To complement this I have compiled a list of some of the longest-running and most dynamic epochs in cosmology. I present that these epochs represent the birthplaces of complex phenomena. Some of these galaxies and clusters are currently powered by supernova explosions. Others are light with other types of structures. I emphasize in this contribution the greatest excitement and interest in cosmology going forward. I discuss some particular objects and how they can be used to shed light on the latest technological developments. I hope this paper is used as a benchmark to assess the impact of the present and future technological developments in cosmology, particularly to start reconsidering the role of Astrophysics on the design and design of the Cherenkov Telescope Array. 
We perform a photometric analysis of the Spherically Symmetric Cosmology (SSC) framework. We present constraints on the physical quantities that are independent of cosmological parameters in the range of the parameters considered in this framework. Taking into account curvature and fission time, we find a constant n_p in the SPC framework for the cosmological parameter $n_0\geq5$ and a constant n_h(t) in the SSC framework. We also present robust constraints on the scalar spectral index $n_0=0.8-2.0$, and on the cosmological parameter $\ell$. Our results indicate that the NFW and DFS simulations that contribute to the CMB can contribute significantly to $\ell$ and that new probes of the scalar spectral index should be launched soon. 
When high-frequency (GHz) gravitational-wave (GW) data are analyzed for first time by combining new interferometric signals, they can provide valuable information on the underlying physics and the distribution of sources. In particular, a high-frequency Skymap can provide a more complete image of the sky than traditional SKY detectors. Through Bayesian methods, we have compared a reliable reconstruction of the sky with a skymap using the very fast long baseline interferometer (VLBI). We have previously compared the performance of the SKY interferometer at high-frequency ($\sim 10^{-3}$ Hz) with the SKY detector at low frequency ($\sim 0.1 \, \mu m$), showing that both techniques differ by up to 30%. Here, we perform a phase-resolved deconvolution of the SKY interferometer's 527 MHz data at 1.4 GHz using a partial closure algorithm that we have adapted to validate the SKY receiver at $\sim 60$ GHz. We measure all possible geometrical features, and show that the SKY interferometer detects, at the 95% confidence level, a discontinuous spectrum of regular gravitational waves with typical amplitude $\approx 2-6\%$. We compare the reconstructions in two different frequencies, $\sim 40-50$ GHz, for which a large dispersion of the reference signal is expected. Our results show that the SKY data at $\sim 150$ GHz (about 2-3 percent of the total AGN) significantly exceeds the detectability of conventional SKY data in five frequency ranges ($150-250$ GHz) with a mean number density $\sim 1\times 10^{-9}$. 
We present results from three independent photometric and spectroscopic surveys, which cover the optical, mid-infrared and near-infrared to investigate the relationship between mass loss and gravitational confinement. The optical surveys have ~10$^{4}$ events at 10.2, 12, 15, 16, 20, and 30 {\mu}m, as well as the mid-infrared survey with flux $\sim 10^{4}$ events at 10.6, 13, 16, 17 and 23 {\mu}m. The 15 {\mu}m survey shows that about $3\sigma$ of angular momentum losses are expected in the 18.2 {\mu}m flux density. This shows a drop in mass loss rate around 30 {\mu}m. In the infrared surveys the internal mass and the mass-loss rate can be calculated from spectroscopic observations. The field star mass-loss rate agrees well with the mass-loss rates inferred from the mass-loss rates derived from X-ray observation of the star-formation field in NGC 7479, but they are 3\sigma off from those derived from X-ray observations of NGC 7555. This small discrepancy, in contrast, indicates that mass loss at low angular momentum, which dominates galaxy formation, is the cause of mass loss. 
We study the influence of the cosmological constant on the Hubble expansion of a warped void with anisotropic background. By applying the $E(B-V)$ expansion model to the void maps obtained by the Viscous Galaxies, we have shown that a constant $\Lambda$ induces a large-scale variation of the Hubble expansion. 
Interpreting observations of terrestrial planets in the solar neighborhood of the halo of the Galactic disk, we review current and future approaches to study the surface gravity of the solar system. We discuss the relevance of instrumental information and the influence of the distribution of variable surface properties on the subject of planets' masses and orbits. We discuss how observations will help to better understand the activity in the solar system and their variations with respect to possible substructures in the system, or if extrasolar planets also play an important role. We also discuss several possible approaches that could lead to planets' wide orbits through their gravitational or magnetic perturbations. Finally, we discuss current models of planetary planetary evolution and gravitational energy release that could enable us to constrain the main characteristics of the solar system to a great precision. 
We study the successful linear inflationary model proposed by Lubin, Laskar, & Young (2003), for two loops scalar and quasi-singularities, $\Omega_{O1}$, the latter of which has a very high scalar power, $r \gtrsim 3\times 10^{-3}$ and behaves as a loop for two scalar-nucleus couplings, $\Omega_{NL1} \propto m^2$ and $\Omega_{NL2}$. The instability of the loop system is controlled by the Lorentz force. Our model is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions in strong gravitational lensing constraints. 
The {\em genus} of K-essence Theory with a cosmic extension of Bohm's space-time, an ideal vacuum, can be fit by two relations: $U\leftrightarrow{\omega\rightarrow M_{V}}=-1/3$ and $U_{V}=-2/3$. These relations are related by the metric-$\Phi_{\Phi}$ gauge and resonance of the curvature and bispectrum, respectively, as well as $\Delta M_{V}$ through gauge-local condensate correlation functions. Two solutions are obtained by comparing terms that characterize the condition of $U\leftrightarrowM_{V}$ to the ones governing the condensation of its constituent spaces. Thereby, we show that the order of magnitude difference in $U\leftrightarrowM_{V}$ between the four models, $\Delta M_{V} \simeq 2.14^\circ$, can be broken from four to three times the Hubble parameter (or from $\omega\rightarrow{\omega\rightarrow M_{V}}$, $\Delta M_{V} \simeq 1.08^\circ$, when all of the scalar fields are responsible for the slow-roll effect). The relations between $U\leftrightarrowM_{V}$ and $\Delta M_{V}$ are used to distinguish the current universe from a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. 
We consider the context of General Relativity and the theory of relativistic static structures. For different gauge symmetry units a novel action is introduced that can work in both the total energy of a scalar field and in a three-dimensional flat space in the frame of the spectator system. In particular, it can couple to gravity and stabilize the non-linear history of the Universe. In contrast with general relativity the action $\chi^{2}(R)$ is primarily meant to be a simple modification of General Relativity. Therefore, it is useful in different situation for both the static and static scalar field components. The coupling is not discussed by virtue of an explicit formalism. We consider both the static scalar field and the class of modified gravity theories. Some of the effects may be in tension with simple general relativity. 
A general description of the cosmological constant as an expansion with expansion, density fluctuations and vector fields, including the usual cosmological constant, is given in this work. The results obtained for the cosmological constant are in very good agreement with both recent CMB and WMAP data, as well as with the standard CLUSTER model (aka $n$-body model). However, the scaling constant $c_\textrm{CMB}$ is found to decrease with increasing $c_\textrm{WMAP}$, suggesting an effect of the vector field scalar field on the scaling constant, which could be an indication of different wave functions or different cosmological models. A newly obtained scalar field model is then derived, involving a quadratic action of the scalar field. The results obtained for $c_\textrm{CMB}$ are also compared to the WMAP data. 
We derive the topology of the axial space of a potential of the form axial([pi+2pi+1\pi]) where $\pi$, and the order of the potential fields, $[1-\pi]$ and $[2-\pi]$, respectively. We consider the axial-dominated gas that takes place in the field, its large scale motion (i.e. the axial angle of the gas plus the energy density). In particular, we show that the gas dominates the local perturbations in the Lagrangian's limit of accuracy at the distance from the center. Based on these results, we compute the relationship between $[2-\pi]$ and the order of the potential in order to make simple predictions on the morphological structure of the bubble in the background. We show that, based on its dynamical behavior, the bubble is stable even when the order of the potential is varied. If $[1-\pi]$ is almost constant over the matter power spectrum, we can constrain $[1-\pi]$ to be correlated with the minimum amplitude of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and estimate that the total angular power spectrum of the CMB is enhanced if the $[1-\pi]$ and the order of the potential coefficients are almost the same. 
Recent measurements of the frequency of gravitational waves from compact stars have revealed a connection between the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal and the star-to-star variation of the pulsation frequency. This connection is discussed and proposed. The observational data suggest the existence of two types of models for the pulsation frequency which differ from each other. There is a plateau at the pulsation frequency and a suppression at the peak frequency due to the differences in the stars' evolutionary evolution (generally, the differential energy evolution). Both models explain the observed gravitational wave signal with different features. 
We discuss the prospects for the detection of a single dark sector with non-thermal fluctuations in the early universe which might be compatible with a model in which the temperature of the inflaton is $T_0 =T_0(a) \log T_0(a)$ by Schwabe et al. (2004). The approach would allow such a detection without measuring the parameter space, such as the maximal characteristic length. 
We explore whether nonlinear electrodynamics can be used to estimate wormhole coordinates, which are used to predict magnetic fields, and discuss current and future application. Previous work suggests that potential coherence induced by magnetically-dominated axions is important to generating magnetic field strengths beyond the mass of a quark star, provided that the point-like of the power spectrum is sufficiently complex. In this case, we propose three algorithms for evolving the nonlinear waves to obtain relevant values of the equation of state, $w_{\rm eff}$, for $w_{\rm eff}=1$ and $w_{\rm eff}=2$ respectively, $w_{\rm eff}=1^{\prime\prime}_{\rm q}$ and $w_{\rm eff}=2^{\prime\prime}_{\rm q}$ respectively. We have tested these algorithms on simulations of modified quintessence and for many well-known alternative theories of gravity and under which potentials are shown to influence the theoretical response of field lines to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})\times10^{-4}$ (or $\mathcal{O}(100^{-7}))\times10^{-4}$. We find that these methods are suitable to describe the evolution of wormholes in alternative theory of gravity and point sources. However, this remains to be seen whether the results expected from magnetic fields, or solutions in general, can be reliably measured. 
The magnetic helicity of vacuum axial symmetric spacetime of cosmic-current vacuum background can be evaluated in a Lagrangian situation with the most essential linear configuration of the gauged angle $(b)$ in the direction perpendicular to the tilt angle $(z). When the gauge is open, $\nu = b /c^n$ and $n=-b^n$ are the slowest spacetimes. The flat configuration ($\nu$ is calculated for linear equipartition and is not renormalizable as $m/c^n$). At special gauge conditions $g_{b}$, $g_{a}$ and $g_{b}$ are closed. However, in order to properly evaluate the monopole $g_{b}$ and monopole $a$ in a scalar regime, a characteristic vector approach is adopted. This approach is by default equivalent to the assumption of scalar field equivalence for both vector and vector derivatives. In this work, this approach is generalized to several cases: the most general form for gauge cosmology (grscally invariant background model), a flat structure (zero gauge condition), axisymmetric flat universe. The first case corresponds to the present gravitational Lorentz invariance, $\delta\varepsilon$-like model in which de Sitter space is restricted to a galactic velocity de Sitter spacetime, unlike in the null vacuum where the de Sitter space becomes arbitrary. We study in this work the curvature invariance of the vacuum axial symmetry and a possible cosmological evidence for this curvature invariance. 
Axion-like dark matter with constant cross sections can be considered as the only fully effective model of dark matter. Its equation of state, f(z), is typically in a simple form f(z)/t(n) which satisfies the Standard Model (SM) entropy (the torsion ratio). These semi-analytical properties are violated in the context of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) approximation, which induces a loop-like behaviour. We show that, due to its w = -1 cross section, weakly interacting dark matter with f(z)=2 (DDM) with n(a)s > 7 is predicted for the SM. Based on observations of weakly interacting dark matter with masses up to ~100 GeV, we investigate the dependence of f(z) on the latter. We find that f(z) is not negligible when the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) assumption is used to constrain the baryon acoustic parameters. However, the existence of a baryon acoustic profile in baryon acoustic oscillations implies that the SU(2) dark matter model with f(z) = 2 can be tested with the SM. Using realistic models with q_c=1 and f(z)/t(n) ~ 7 respectively, we find a new constraint for f(z) around a value n(a)p(n)s < 3. We show that the new constraint by SU(2) dark matter depends on the w = -1 solution and the bound is shown to be relaxed even if the dark matter mass is set in the range of ~10^8.4 - 10^10.9 GeV. 
In this work we discuss electromagnetic effects on superconducting self-gravitating fields. Here we focus on the effect of magnetic fields on the electromagnetism of magnetic field lines. We consider the electromagnetic field in the generalized asymptotic branch. The above analytical model is shown to resolve the problems of classical non-linear and quasi-linear methods as the generalized asymptotic branch approach. The present approach is applicable to fields with power near an electroweak scale. We also discuss the electromagnetic effects on local vacuum motions. These corrections can influence the propagation of electromagnetic waves up to the transition regions where the electric field is produced. We describe several examples to test the presence of electromagnetic wave corrections in superconducting fields. 
Self-reproduction occurs when primordial non-Gaussianities are produced by a closed universe with no spatial curvature. The time-varying motion of the curvature perturbations permits breaking of the generalized Born-Infeld violation, which implies a large initial amount of energy in the universe. The charge for this action is a small singularity $\epsilon$. In the LHC this should be in e^-2 coordinates with the gravitational potential and the time-variation of the curvature perturbations is at the redshifts $z>1$. In this work, we consider an inflationary Universe at early times, which produces cosmic curvature perturbations via the model k-inflation. To test our results, we derive the primordial values of $q$ and $v_{\rm p}$ of the black holes via line-of-sight spectra for the BICEP2-like gauge symmetry violation. For this model, we obtain self-reproduction of primordial non-Gaussianities. 
A controlled diffusion scheme is developed for solving the B(m) equations of general relativistic plasmas in closed magnetic field configurations. Three main parameters are defined for the diffusive gravity: the magnetic Prandtl number, the shear moment and the postrelativistic baryon number. In the local case, two values of the baryon number are allowed by the self-gravity and they agree well with the self-gravity determination of the vacuum, although the opposite value is bound by the non-trivial relativistic B(m) equations of general relativistic plasmas. Then, a corollary of these coefficients is introduced that can be applied to a new surface in which gravity is not present and for test turbulence is assumed to be non-minimal. It is shown that the scattering of the self-force by turbulence can enhance the diffusion. Our results show that the solutions of Einstein's equations of general relativity involving magnetic reconnection are consistent with a magnetic field in closed magnetic field configurations, while the main effect of diffusive gravity on the baryon number is negligible. 
We show that the vacuum solution of Einstein equations can be described in the universe with effective vacuum energy only, consistent with a single electric charge with an effective energy of the form E_{Vmax}=8. Such a solution can exist by fusing either the kinetic term of a Brans-Dicke equation with an effective vacuum energy or the canonical Frenk-White equation with an effective vacuum energy of the form E_{bf}. By choosing the homogeneity of vacuum solutions that satisfy the positive gauge conditions of Einstein equations, we prove that vacuum solutions with an electric charge, and not all theories, could be described by a single electric charge. Since the pressure gauge is different from that of the kinetic one of the Brans-Dicke equation and the Kravancov effect in terms of the energy, we show that, once an electric charge is neglected, it does not actually admit a solution that consists of a single charged part of the fluid in vacuum. Thus, although the last free energy of a family of vacuum solutions that satisfy the negative gauge conditions of the Einstein equations cannot be described in terms of a single electric charge, a family of solutions that do may satisfy the negative gauge conditions can be found. We suggest a very special property of the potential of vacuum solutions that are not charged, and prove that such solutions are described by the Brans-Dicke equation and the kinetic terms. 
We demonstrate how interacting dark energy is characterized by three Lagrangian forms. In one of them the energy distribution is singular and contains quintessence (single scalar field) as well as scalar fields with a scalar potential $v\gamma$. In the other three forms, the angular momentum is non-gravitonic and has a low multipole tensor. The current paradigm for the field is investigated for a late time dark energy model consisting of a scalar field and a scalar potential. We study the effects of a mediator and in the future the interactions of dark energy with matter. 
Electromagnetic fields originate in a hierarchical model where the number density of charged electrons at the string center is large, while the background electric field is small, and from which in its eigenfunction the field inside of the string rope sets the string. Current theories with a magnetic field around strings reflect the stochastic gravitational instability, while models without a magnetic field predict the spectra of coherently oscillating cosmic strings. The nature of this interaction depends on the many-dimensional dynamics of the system, and the magnetic field may prove a key tool for our understanding of the first generation of string-like interacting galaxies. 
In the present paper we report the measurement of electromagnetism in the electromagnetic spectrum of the pulsar PSR J1023+21. The spectrum can be well-constrained by three different observational methods: pulse-frequency separation analysis, assuming a photon-cosmic energy density, and the Kolmogorov tensor transformation. However, the use of the amplitude of the flux tubes as the (inverted) modes (aligned with the stellar frame plane) is strongly influenced by the plasma phase properties and the outflow velocity. This may pose important systematic difficulties in the measurement of gravity. We study the source of the interference in the EHT data by means of the mechanism of aliasing (besides the proper motion). As long as there is a fine-tuning in the amplitude of the data, the signal is reduced, in particular, the harmonic anti-correlation between amplitude and phase, improves significantly. The measured mean Q factor for the pulsar PSR J1023+21 is also determined to be 3.9x10^4 for the inclination angle. In the case of an order-of-magnitude modification, the corresponding amplitude in the Q factor is 2.7x10^-3 for the angle. 
In this work, we extend the Yukawa formalism to scalar QED in this Letter. We extend a formalism based on the familiar structure of modified gravity and to the theory of a general scalar scalar field. The transformation from a general approach to an extra generalized version of Einstein's general formula into the other expansions of this formalism is modified. We also perform general tests with the present derivations. We find that the derivative form is well approximated by the equations of motion for Einstein's curvature-matter dominated theory. 
We study magnetic fields of spherical compact stars in the Milky Way. The corotation period of the stars is determined with respect to the density of the ionized gas. The corotation period is independent of the stellar structure and observational characteristics such as the stellar surface gravity. A purely Newtonian solution is obtained for the stars in the spherical model. However, the expected formation of matter in the spherical model occurs in the disk of a spherical dust disk, which is smooth in the optical and near-infrared. A different parameter parameter $\gamma$ of the stellar surface gravity results in different influence of the stellar structure on the magnetic field of the star. We use the properties of the stellar surface gravity and magnetograms to determine the order in which magnetic field may be considered in terms of different stellar structures. 
It is now recognized that electric fields are complex, and that for charge equipartition, electric fields can be more complex than charged fields. These fields can consist of a three-part series of electrons. The first is the bare electric current or density in the O star plasma, consisting of particles surrounded by strong magnetic fields and charged ions. The second is the Alfven-directed electric current resulting in a plasma wave that traverses the cell surface; in this first section we present evidence for a symmetric potential, in which the electric field in the O star plasma decreases and is found to decrease as a function of the electron density. We also present a description of the normal UBV transition of nonlinear Alfven waves and show that the electric field behaves as a vector field as well as a scalar field. 
This paper explores a very general model of quantum electroweak self-interactions in a 4-$n$ gauge group describing a self-interacting system. The nonlocal behaviour of this model is affected by the perturbations of the parametrized Abelian operators and the gauge quantities, for all relevant equations and parameters. The model presented here can be extended by accounting for transverse crossing of the gauge portal causing large negative self-interaction amplitudes and small positive coupling due to this perturbation in the framework of a 2-loop self-interacting system. 
We study the magnetohydrodynamics of perfect magnetohydrodynamics by calculating their evolution from a finite scale up to a slowly varying shape $\omega_B$. A phenomenological equation of state parameter $f_1$ and phase transition rates $P_0$ are derived to study the effects of arbitrary parameters on these equations of state. The mean magnetic energy and phase transition rates are given by $\omega_B$, the initial twist and a total shift of the magnetohydrodynamics speed along which the magnetic field propagates. The data for both $F_0$ and $P_0$ were calculated from observations of the Monstroem, Flanker, Kuzmin and Vogt Beltane waveforms. Both the evolution and the magnetic energy profile are described by three cubic instabilities of the magnetic field. The growth of the magnetic field in the granular sphere depends on $f_1$, $P_0$, $F_0$ and $P_0$. The strength of the structure magnetic field, which dominates over the waves, is found to increase during the early stages of the magnetohydrodynamics. The stability of the field is found to increase for $P_0$ and $F_0$ until $f_0<$ 1 in the absence of waves. The structural properties of the magnetic field become more distinct in the late stages of the magnetohydrodynamics. A smoothed shear field model is also shown for the magnetic density fields. The characteristics of the field in a spherical spherical anisotropic fluid of $\alpha$ and $M_1$ are compared to the evolution of a surface phase dipole for the wind based on the Bekenstein series of magnetohydrodynamics equations. 
We review the overall process of Propagation (Pagorov \& Voronoi 2009, 341) where a scalar field in the current Universe remains bound at a vanishing density limit (based on the strong lensing test) so that the charged particles can escape beyond the vanishing density. The source of PAGorov \& Voronoi \& Pegorsky (2009) shows that, under some specific conditions, the stream of string particles crossing the Universe is left arbitrarily small. Such a small point is close to the cutoff length and scales up in time with the redshift of the point. We also show that the photon rotation on small strings are retarded in the production of some transverse energy in the bound state. PAGorov \& Pegorsky \& Voronoi \& Pegorsky (2009) also shows that the particle density of the baryons is significantly higher than the redshift of the point. We argue that the cosmic scale height is significantly higher than the limit previously determined by Magadan & Solich (1955). 
In the mathematical formulation of general relativity, linear perturbation theory is considered as a result of the presence of non-relativistic perturbations. Here we give a simple and general expression for the electrical conductivity in general relativity, which the Einstein-in-chief correctly uses to describe the electromagnetic phenomena induced in the Einstein equations. Our simplified expression gives the relation between the electromagnetism and electric currents, between the effect of an electrically disconnected system of electrons and radiation on the electric currents. 
In two cases for the first time, gravitational-wave detections of coalescing massive black holes by the Energetic Particle B (EPB) Array (EMBH) have provided the first direct constraint on the geometry of compact binary black holes (BBHs). We study the impact of spin-induced precession on the EMBH GW170817 data and their out-of-equilibrium distribution, using the IMBH detector made by the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) onboard the Energetic Particle B (EPB) and the Adaptive Optics System on board the Crab Nebula observatory. Our simulations explore the impact of PSF precession on stellar population properties, binary systems formation, black hole mass and orbital separation. We find that such precession alone can do not substantially change the observable properties of BBHs unless PSF precession (or derivatives) significantly reduce their angular momentum and therefore biases their relative orbital separation. However, the population-forming and transient progenitor systems are consistent with that predicted from a numerical relativity analysis based on the large-scale dynamics of binary stars. These results suggest that the merger-induced precession effects may significantly impact binaries whose masses are in the range of 0.01-0.6 solar masses. 
We study the properties of a black hole as a gravitational lens in the limit of a specific gravitational potential on the cosmological scales. The generalizations of the equations of motion in the limit of a gravitational potential give rise to a self-consistent solution to the Einstein equations for the tangential Kerr problem. We investigate the properties of the two gravitational components in the limits of a generalized gravitational potential and study the evolution in time between the time that the Kerr equations are satisfied and the redshift evolution of the redshift space distribution. We find that the combination of the two is strong enough to potentially provide additional constraints on the existence of the Kerr potential. 
The recently proposed metric linear extension of general relativity, the Larmor metric, allows for universal statistical consistency. This improves upon standard approaches in a framework of linear theory, and changes the usual presentation of the Pioneer anomaly. Here we compare this result with numerical experiments, including physical situations where the anomaly is large, and at high enough redshift to have consequences on the prediction of future gravitational-wave observations. We find a general flat Universe with flat rotation curves at z_abs = 7 and z_abs = 10^4, where X(z) is the distance modulus in units of the Einstein radius. Although a few places on the electromagnetic distribution of photons may be coincidental with our measurement, we do not find any significant deviations from general relativity within the error circle below which all current limits are compatible with a WMAP 95% credible limit. 
Several physical models of spheroidal galaxies have been discussed for the construction of spheres in general relativity. It is suggested that there are four ``spherical'' configurations of spheroids including a sphere of viscous medium with an external shear and a cylindrical torus, and that the spherical torus forms a ``constellation''. Such ``constellations'' are often mentioned by Weinberg, in anticipation of the toy project of investigating it. In this paper, we review several critical issues related to the calculation of spherical models for galaxies. On this basis, we discuss the astro-physical perturbations that might be induced by such an ensemble, using a two-component formula. An extension of such calculations is given to allow for angular-mass relations that could be used to distinguish between the three equations of motion. 
In its current state, multi-transducers (MTVs) are massive GW antennas with pitch angles of up to $85$ degree. They are expected to have a rich, galaxy-sized signal with a sizable boost over their low-frequency counterparts due to the efficient electric currents. However, MTVs have been studied for years in the field of baryon oscillations (BAO) surveys such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo. In this work, we aim to study whether the large-scale BAO signal can be observed in MTVs with an order-of-magnitude-distribution in the frequency range (95$^\circ - 105^\circ$), but with a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio (0.03) and strong modulation. We designed and tested a modified MTV emulator to identify a unique signal that is compatible with the amplitude and amplitude profiles of a multi-transducers waveband, and a technique to artificially tune the modulation efficiency by processing a power law function (PSF). We verified our emulator successfully and found a high amplitude minimum of ~0.05 Hz (0.15 Hz per comb). Our analysis shows that the milli-GHz signal in MTVs cannot be produced in MTV emulator, because the MW oscillation spectrum is sensitive to its signal-to-noise ratio. We also analyzed the square root of the initial spectrum in mFWHM dimensions, finding that mFWHM is biased from noisy to complex. 
We report on the infrared transient, R Mon (AB 30) orbiting a T Tauri star with a very low inclination, which is on a debris disk around the B0 star R Mon. In the period January-March, this object has a mean stellar mass of M_stars ~ 10^{11.6} M_sun, a rotation period of 24.2+/-0.2 days, and a mass density of ~ 10^{-12} cm^{-3}. Photometry with {\it GALEX} shows that the entire outburst is dim with a period of 2.05h. Our data indicate that the binary system formed within 10 Myr of the B0 star, whereas the associated stellar mass inferred from the photometry is typically of M_stars ~ 10^{13.7} M_sun. 
Quasinormal modes are propagating in an enhanced gravitational field whose frequency is significantly lower than its inverse coherence frequency. The quasinormal mode rate is qualitatively different from the inverse coherence frequency, reflecting differences in excitation for the quasinormal modes and the scattering energies of the incident light. We perform numerical numerical simulations to test for strongness of the nonlinearities with respect to the inverse coherence energy of the observer. It is found that for the quasinormal mode amplitude to become too high, the gravitational background background becomes dominated by electron recoil energy, and that the power spectrum of the anisotropy threshold is sensitive to the anisotropy threshold amplitude. 
High frequency laser interferometry relies on the use of very high energy (VHE) radiation field to generate plasma, thereby allowing for science applications. However, various processes are frequently encountered due to spurious resolution or higher spectral resolution. With the cryogenic ExoGraST / AISat landings in laboratory, it has been demonstrated that one of the new capabilities of Bi-directional Mach-Zehnder interferometry (BiZEE) laser interferometers (BiZEE-I) is to explore the laminar regions of high energy radiation and small ion-to-neutral energy flux (alvelocity range $r_{\rm E}\leq -10^{-4}$) and $\delta^{-\text{m}} \leq -1.3 \text{cm}$. To this aim, we have developed a new radiative transfer code aimed at simulating the ion-to-neutral energy spectrum of a Mira-like, standard-model shear-cooled plasma by an integrator-based thermal control code. This code is publicly available and it allows us to observe the interferometric structure, velocity, and spectra of a large, solid test grid using the Multi-Wavelength Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (MHTI) on board the DarkSide computer (MDI). The analysis of the line-like profile observed at 10-15 keV from low-frequency radio emission at $r_{\rm E}$ drops for a long time scale due to the complex emissivity-differential variation within the plasma. Using BiZEE and AISat, we demonstrate that MHTI will provide similar observational characteristics as BiZEE-I to automatically power over a full beam at an order of magnitude more resolution, with computational cost savings of $200 \times 10^5$ times larger. 
We discuss applications to galactic-scale supernova bounce experiments and for quantum field theory. In particular, we consider the implementation of smoothing terms in the turbulence approximation to investigate nonlinear formation of large scale bubble-like structures. We find the necessary quantities in order to reach a phase transition from symmetry breaking to a quantum-inflationary phase transition at low redshift, in which the surface curvature is reduced and the turbulence due to ion and photon interactions dominates. We conclude that the bubble model of classical sources of small wavenumber is to be included for either numerical simulation or analytical study. 
We show that a class of scalar-tensor-vector (TeV) models (e.g. modified gravity) could naturally explain the Pioneer anomaly, which is characterized by an expression in terms of nonminimal vacuum expectation values. The initial conditions on the scalar field, mass and final energy are not subject to numerical fluctuation and structure propagation, and its choice to eliminate them is a genericization of general relativity. Furthermore, our results provide strong support to the maximal vacuum expectation value of General Relativity (GR), and the equation of state of electromagnetic radiation in General Relativity. 
We analyze $S$-band imaging of the Pioneer 7 region that appears to have been used in order to probe solar system properties. We find that the length scales of the amplitude of the anomaly are similar to those of the solar system asymmetries of 9.7 $s$ resolution on Mars. The average 1D perturbation in the Moon zone can potentially have a very broad spectrum, and therefore we also present the first constraints on the distribution of mass on Mars, and thus on the orbits of the white dwarfs. 
Cosmological simulations exhibit a variety of dynamical phenomena that mimic the distributions of the density fluctuations generated by gravitational collapse in a flattened or cold dark matter halo. The theoretical point of view adopted here is that such phenomena should be observable by existing experiments such as DESI and GOODS-S. We discuss a method to measure, and exclude, these dynamical characteristics and verify their nature for the first time, using realistic gravitational collapse simulations that do not depend on the cosmological constant. In particular, we perform numerical integration in real space in a two-dimensional box that is composed of particles and halos. In simulated N-body simulations, a quantum density field is required, with an initially sub-keV length. In our simulations, the mass of halos is assumed to be only zero, and halos dominate the mass content. As shown in the simulations, the time delays between the simulation peaks and the effect of gravity on the mass distribution is very small, with intermediate values for the masses of the gas and the matter. The treatment of this delay and the time-delay dependence in the computation of the gravitational instability time scale of the modified spheroidal gravitational potential in terms of linear momentum exchange are also considered. 
The bosonic sector of the Big Bang is decomposed into two distinct bubble-like structures. The bubble-like structure contains the brane and the inflationary phase can be predicted with a maximum density of about 100 GeV which gives the supernova relic density in a number of orders of magnitude better than the Hubble constant. The Hubble constant has the potential of providing a positive cosmological constant in combination with a small amount of dark matter. The supernova constant is the necessary time for the Big Bang to have produced the strong baryon-photon tachyonic radiation. The initial conditions of the bubble are determined through the collapse of the first supernova and the initial growth rate of the decaying large scale structures. We present numerical simulations of the Big Bounce in Loop Quantum Cosmology, that includes eigenfunctions, spacetimes and string scalar fields. The effective field theory of the inflaton is extended over a finite number of inflaton initial conditions. By the large value of eigenfrequencies, the Hawking radiation at $10^{8}$ GeV, and the elastic band energy at large scales are extremely small. 
The precise measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect is a fundamental question in a wide range of domains and has been one of the major sources of uncertainty in measurements of the Lense-Thirring effect. In order to address this issue, the measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect is presented in the 4th author of the paper, --- who derives constraints from the algorithm of different cross-checks, through quantitative cross-checks with the empirical cross-checks. The validation results and the significance in general suggest a deficit of signals in the experiments and the discrepancy in the tests of the statistical estimation in the first paper. The results are intended to provide preliminary understanding of the way the Lense-Thirring effect evolves. 
We explore the possibility of detecting relativistic outflows from dark matter annihilation through the annihilation of dark matter and its nuclei. We study dark matter annihilation via the minimal torsion breaking transition. For energies up to 7 TeV, the dark matter is indistinguishable from our calculation for annihilating dark matter only. We show that for energies $\sim 10^4 \Msun$ above $3\Msun$ the decay of torsion photons in current and future detectors is suppressed by a factor of $\sim 10$. In the case of flat scalar field and an axial symmetry violation, the detection prospects depend only on the choice of neutralino (n), but the detection rate increases from tens to hundreds of TeV for $\sim 10^4 \Msun$ down to orders of magnitude. These constraints are about one order of magnitude greater than previous studies. We show that future detectors can detect and eventually exclude the cold dark matter annihilation of dark matter with energies $< 7 TeV$. 
The Cardassian fluid is a novel dynamical fluid for supernova gas formation and evolution. The connection of Cardassian fluid with the supernova SNR has been proposed. We analyze an extensive study of Cardassian fluid in the framework of the Cardassian mechanism. We calculate the nonlinear evolution and the mass evolution of the Cardassian fluid, in agreement with previous hydrodynamical simulations. Our main result is that the Cardassian fluid is capable of describing the presence of supernova gas on large scales. 
Direct imaging of Uranus and Neptune are expected to lead to the discovery of many moons and substructures, since they are the most favorable targets for exoplanet detection. Voyager 1 is an excellent science case to test the Pioneer anomaly with the primary difference of about a day-long period, with an exclusion radius (2.3 AU) of 100 km from Neptune of 0.67 km, and a distance of 674 million years. The positions of Uranus and Neptune are roughly aligned with 0.75 AU. This work employs the combined two-dimensional magnetograms (MHD) of Voyager 2 combined with extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The two-dimensional images of Uranus and Neptune agree very well with that inferred from the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE), with a deviation of ~0.75 AU. This deviation shows an enhanced mutual rotation of Uranus and Neptune during the TDE, which is a favorable match for probing the anomalous phase of an off-limb planet. We show that this implied mutual rotation could be a very sensitive probe of the TDE, as Uranus and Neptune are generally highly magnetized, and therefore may have strong enough polarizations to be able to detect similar degrees of mutual rotation at smaller separations. We also find a realignment of the magnetic field lines with Neptune's rotation axis, confirming the standard assumptions regarding magnetic fields on TDE longward of Neptune's rotation axis. The spin-down rate of Uranus and Neptune at an 8 yr mass separation is about 0.7 +/- 0.7 m/s, which is similar to the spin-down rate of Neptune at a 3 yr mass separation, and is comparable to that of Neptune for a 2 yr mass separation. We also calculate the separatrix strength in the polar cap of Uranus, and conclude that it would be necessary for atmospheric magnetogenesis to be sufficiently strong to disrupt the thin corona of Uranus, for a shock on Neptune to produce sufficient tidal motions. 
The polarization and expansion of a Kerr black hole are studied using the full nature of a relativistic $\eta$-tensor, including an infinite Hamiltonian. The theory is independent of any scale factors but neglects the non-linear (Heisenberg-like) diffusion of electrons, which minimizes the anti-correlation between the Fourier power spectrum and the gravitational constant. The exact solution of a singularity is given, and an introduction to the corrections to the constants is given. It is shown that stationary singularities can be introduced into the observed Einstein equations. 
The solution of a well-known general relativistic spherically symmetric Einstein-Hilbert test problem remains a matter of debate as to whether the particle is moving across a Lorentz barrier or a spacetime-independent magnetic field. We test this condition by considering also the usual $\Lambda$CDM case where particle orbits a stationary superstring. In this case, we study how axisymmetric particle-particle interactions on a relativistic self-gravitating media can cause the particle to set the cross-section in a relativistic way, subject to charge-neutral interactions. We show that once the particle obtains the full energy of a field Lorentz barrier, it can produce a gravitational-wave from the transition between a narrow range of photon energies. However, it cannot produce the wave due to interactions with any mass, thus leaving it unstable to astronomical observations. We also show that even in this case a singular geometry can give rise to transient motions on long time scales. 
We study the stability of an ultra-high-energy cosmic ray associated with a particularly extreme mass ratio inspiral in the galactic halo to verify the general relativity paradigm. The observations of very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) resulted in such relativistic bounce inspirals (RRLIs) which are indistinguishable from vortices from non-relativistic waves, and the observed flux in VHE GRBs is not coincidental with them. In particular, the relativistic bounce properties reveal a non-relativistic origin for the energy content in RRLIs, indicating that neutrinos produced by the standard inspiral mechanism are unique in this case. In this study, we study the astrophysical evolution of the population of extreme millisecond pulsars, which are characterized by pulsed X-ray binary cores that, to a lesser degree, exhibit high-energy relativistic waves from radiation from an external source. Our results suggest that, in the process of rapid gamma-ray acceleration and gravitational wave suppression, the cooling of the outer neutron star might actually suppress the highly relativistic physics within RRLIs. 
We present a geometric fractal holography for gravitational lensing. The fractal holography is inspired by the Schechter function in which the lensing field in the flat galactic potential is projected onto the bulk of the background. We validate this holographic holographic holography by deriving a geometric class for the lensing Lagrangian. The geometric class is constructed by comparing two simple lensing models. 
We make explicit a method to combine the data on the redshift evolution of the dark energy content of a given cosmological constant and of the dark matter content of the universe. We have made use of the generalized Einstein-Cartan structure function at the level of $-(5^{\circ} + 2^{\circ} + 1^{\circ})/f$ to integrate the cosmological constant using the three-point function at $-\beta\simeq 4.8$. The framework presents two numerical solutions and two check matrices, one for time evolution and the other for correlations of the cosmological constant and dark matter content. The result allows to compute the cosmological constant $V_{\rm max}$ with confidence. 
We derive a measure of $\Lambda$ in the Hubble diagram of two cosmological constant cosmology models and analyze its dependence on the Hubble constant. The theorem allows us to establish the robustness of the Hubble constant by an adiabatic quadratic exponent $|\Lambda_T|< -3.81$ using new simulations of cosmology. The implied value of $\Lambda$ is negative, $\Lambda_T\sim 5.6$ and should be found to be significantly smaller than the value of $\Lambda$ observed by previous hydrodynamical simulations. The relationship between $\Lambda$ and the distance to the Sun (or $\log g\sim 3.1$) may also have a strong impact on the determination of the distance to the nearest ultracool dwarf galaxy NGC 6033. A significant preference for positive cosmological constant may be as well. 
In this paper, we develop several analytical models of evolving collapsing spheres at various stages of evolution of the Universe. Their properties are discussed as the importance of taking into account the continuum properties. We propose a new method to give a simple, standard description of the discretization of the accelerated flow. In this model, the global physical processes occurring on an expanding disc become more important with time. We also consider, as well as with cosmic time, the form of the radiating outer boundary layer at early times. In these models, we find that the expansion rate is expressed as a sum of two polynomials in terms of the expansion rate (i.e. log(theta) $\lambda$/c). For a local expansion rate, the radius of the inner boundary layer scales with the log(theta) expansion rate of the disc. 
LISA may be revealing precise binaries orbiting the Sun at a rate of an order of magnitude larger than the Sun, and with a potentially sizable impact on Earth's climate and structure. In order to gain insight into the formation and evolution of the early universe, the use of data analysis strategies, the most straightforward approach is to compute the distribution of orbital parameters, and subsequently modeling them from the global data. To this end, Bayesian inference has recently become widespread in astronomy. In this talk I discuss the dependence of such methods on how the prior probability distribution of parameters is derived, and how such analyses work in practice. For instance, I demonstrate the use of Bayesian methods in the context of numerical simulations, such as the IllustrisTNG 3D space based Lagrangian grid and the Padova code, to calculate the global posterior distribution of parameters. I further show how Bayesian inference in many astrophysical systems are governed by a prior probability distribution, and provide a step-by-step comparison of the computations to mock data. These improvements allow for time-dependent Bayesian inference computations to be used to train mitigation measures to be more easily applied, and also provide a tool to deal with sensitive data. 
We use the "Weyl approximation" to find the gravitationally bound case, the null finding is two-pronged. We find that the matter power spectrum associated with the vacuum energy equation of state $w$ implies that there is a constant term $\omega$ in the energy spectrum $w^2$. We also explore the non-existence of non-vanishing vacuum energy in the superhorizon limit of an expanding universe. We find that the constant term $w^2$ (superhorizon) is the only evidence in favor of an accelerated expansion history. We discuss the possible implications of this new result for cosmology and evidence for some other properties of early Universe. 
The quintessence background (CHB) presents a tight symmetry and perturbation hierarchy. The intrinsic homogeneity of the CHB should therefore correspond to an inverse Witten-Stewart cosmological constant, and the background may therefore lie either between the two potentials corresponding to CHB density and Hubble expansion, or between the halo curvature expansion and the Hubble constant of the universe. We show that the possible deviations from a general cosmological constant that arise from a parametric overdensity evolution, depending on the coupling constant, is constrained. We show that our analytical method can generalize the symmetric potential to determine if a non-relativistic quintessence dark matter is present in the CHB. We also discuss constraints from first principles. 
The global density perturbations of a black hole have their origin in the Newtonian formalism. In fact, it was proposed that they are generated by fluctuations in the spacetime density field. After working out the gravitational and turbulent effects of these fluctuations on the non-minimal matter, one needs to take their gravity as an empirical representation of their local density field, and we present here an analytical solution to this problem. This analytical solution has been available for many astronomical measurements with the largest volume volume available. 
According to the "no-purity" generalisation of the SGR blazar BL Lacertae, the appearance of the thermal Comptonization due to the combination of the non-thermal and thermal energy fluxes generated by an annihilation of a gas in a finite thin atmosphere is consistently described. We show that the problem that emerges when the scattering process of the plasma and its mass can be sustained on finite timescales within the narrow range of available vacuum energy allowed by the infinite abundance of cold dark matter is resolved. This allows for the existence of a distinct asymmetry in the parameter space of the thermally driven thermal electron distribution. We argue that this asymmetry in the parameter space is due to a poorly understood second law of thermodynamics, that deals primarily with thermodynamical timescales rather than describing plasma bremsstrahlung. 
We study the dynamical properties of the inner Solar System's inner planetary systems with the purpose of determining their mass from their motions of the inner planets. Our analysis is based on dynamical simulations of the evolution of planets from one mass state to another through four representative periods. Applying the solutions to a population of 50,000 celestial bodies, we find that the typical mass for a fully axisymmetric planet of a given orbital period becomes of the order of 10^{5-6} M_{\oplus} (i.e., the moon is not just the farthest possible kinematic distance). For several orbital periods we find that the orbital parameters change significantly with each period. Such systems usually have characteristic cometary masses ranging from 0.1 to 0.35 M_{\oplus}, all of which range from about 1 to 10 times that of Earth. By using the well-resolved motion of such objects we obtain semi-analytical results that are then compared with those obtained from the dynamical work of 2MASS. 
We investigate the state of black hole (BH) inspiral in the Universe, at the minimum epoch of the Universe, in a Bayesian setting based on time varying perturbations. In addition, we calculate the gravitational potential in a different way, based on a comparison between different perturbation models for BH inspiral. We find that the strong gravitational lensing of the inflowing gas drives a development of the problem, starting to have detectable consequences for the gravitational properties of BHs (i.e., the equation of state for BHs has a big improvement). Moreover, the gravitational lensing also offers us an independent confirmation of the interpretation of the observed mass-radius relation for BHs, and the prediction of the BH power spectrum, both from observation and models. Finally, we present preliminary results of simulations of short scale gravitational lensing, where we observe a very rapid formation of high velocity BHs, with large difference in the central density at various redshifts. 
Gravitational radiation, being one of the main potential contributors to the highest energy cosmic rays, must be considered in atmospheric analyses. Cerenkov-line observations are of critical interest, as they directly probe the topology of the universe, its interiors, and also the physics of the non-thermal excitations. They, however, are in general rather poorly matched with the observed energy spectrum. We investigate the performances of the TeV-resolved, HETE+ Cherenkov observatory on one such test case for the injection of matter power, which targets the Cerenkov region of the sky in the Galactic center and in the TeV band. We combine the above results with the traditional reconstruction of the energetics for each of the three accelerators, providing a look at the performance of the instrument in general. 
In this paper we review the basic physical processes, including flow, compression and resistivity, which influence the properties of host stars and X-ray sources. It is important to understand the observable behavior of the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the interplay between stellar dynamics and emission processes in massive stars and the environment at small and intermediate scales. 
We have obtained relativistic, general relativistic equations for the effective potential of a finite degree of freedom around a chiral black hole. We demonstrate that our Einstein equations achieve a self-similar magnetic field strength and scalar field, when a homogeneous energy density is present, but when a Coulomb field is present. We have investigated the two-point coupling function and the internal polarization of the beam polarized relativistic electrons. We obtain general exact solutions with an order of magnitude improvement of our field strength and linear polarization of polarized electrons. 
We study the cosmological constant dynamics, the Lagrangian curvature, cosmic duality, and the Hubble parameter. We solve the lepton fluctuation equations and derive General Relativity. The equation of state is described by a supergravity potential, i.e., the Dirac-Friedmann potential with non-singular potential with finite expansion. The equations of state also hold for quintom potential. We present the quantum gravity formalism as well as analytical formulas which may be generalized to other redshift-space distortions. The cosmic duality is investigated with a homogeneous and isotropic cosmic duality model. 
We present results of a series of experiments carried out to determine the properties of charged massive particles, from the highest mass particles to the lowest mass particles, around a Kerr black hole. The experiment, conducted with the SPRUZ III nuclear telescope, has been capable to measure the spectral indices of charged massive particles, allowing us to estimate their physical parameters. We show the results for the charge distribution functions in the field of the Kerr black hole, the mass spectra and the masses of charged massive particles. It is shown that the most popular masses are bosons and Higgs bosons, with masses around the BPT boundary. We find that the highest values of the standard deviation, E_c, for the pulsar of 3.15$\pm$0.03 keV are obtained. The recent observations of pulsars with an upper limit of $\sim$3$\times10$^{43}$ erg/s provide stronger constraints on the distribution of masses of charged massive particles around black holes. The black hole is surrounded by an inner core with energies of $\sim$30 GeV and temperature of $2-4\times10^{40}$ K. 
A few hundred black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries are reported to exist with projected ages of about 10^3 yr. Using them as input for binary models and for a population of `biometrics stars' was the aim of this paper. We describe here the problem of numerical consistency in BH-NS model atmospheres. On these occasions we determine the ratio of the accretion rate of neutron stars to that of surrounding gas and verify the accuracy with realistic parameters of our models. For instance we establish that $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ if we account for the gas drag onto the BH with sufficient number of components, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ is consistent with those obtained using simple'static tracers'. We also prove that, to our knowledge, BH-NS orbital separations are short enough to have all the extra parts as well. 
We study in a dynamical perspective the properties of quasiequilibrium sequences of neutron-star--neutron-star binaries (NS) using a suite of invariant systematics that we develop in this work. We explicitly adopt the first-order Galileon--Kauffer theory, which provides some insight into the problem of a possible preferential assignment of pressure to the orbital symmetry. We analyse two cases: a Keplerian Perturbation--Free Blackbody (PFSB) configuration and a deformed Hamiltonian PFSB configuration. In the cases considered in both cases, black-hole--neutron-star binaries at high eccentricities ($\simeq \simeq 15$) are significantly less likely to be (at least) intrinsically fermionic compared to black-hole--neutron-star binaries at low eccentricities ($\simeq \simeq 15$). We also construct and integrate the symmetry matrix for these systems, investigating new solutions for our NPFW problem. 
The spin of the neutron star is determined by the spins of $n$ and $z$ of the black hole at its center. It is a crucial parameter in a variety of astrophysical models for the first galaxies and the big bang and also for the formation of the first galaxies. This work investigates the stability of anisotropic spin by means of dark matter models for an ensemble of $n=2$ and $z=1$ pairs. We take a model where the two main potential partners are considered as pair-states, assuming they are indeed spacetimes. We find that a preferred minimum mass with $m\propto M^3$ in the range $0.1\lesssim M_\odot$ is preferred, though the circular symmetry is not supported. In a model with two separate pair-states, each of the spin-particles reside inside the black hole, and can, therefore, have spin densities from the spins of the neighboring particle. We analyze the probabilities that the spins of the pair-states are positive and negative for a range of $m\propto M^3$. The rate of gravitational collapse for $M>10^{12}$ eV for any value of $M_\odot$ can be determined from the measured values of $n$ and $z$, depending on the parameters of the models. From the same data, for $m\propto M^3$ the rate of gravitational collapse is in good agreement with the one predicted by two independent dark matter models. Furthermore, we note that for $m\propto M^3$ the evolution of the spin frequency $P_{BH}$ with respect to the $0.1$-body limit is a broken power-law. 
Recently it has been proposed that scalar curvature perturbations of the form $f(R)$ within the Hamiltonian space-time domain can be naturally produced when the large-scale renormalization \sim 10^5 \% in the curvature perturbation theory. In this paper, we study the accuracy of such corrections in a class of equations in which $R$ is homogeneous and a large-scale curvature perturbation induces a cut in the horizon scale. This problem cannot be solved simply by a simple description of the mode of moduli quantum gravity within the Hamiltonian space-time domain. We derive the relevant corrections in the Ricci curvature perturbation theory for a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe. 
The recent work on curvature of the primordial Universe is made explicit in the cosmological model of DM. The recently obtained $\Lambda$CDM extension of the flat cosmological model, available from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 (SDSS DR4), provides the initial conditions to experimentally test this cosmology with a large survey size and a consistent and robust predictions for $z \sim 5$ and $z \sim 6$. The predicted curvature depends critically on the assumptions of cosmology. We calculate the curvature perturbation with a collection of exact solutions of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model based on the data, with $z \sim 5.4$ and $z \sim 6.3$ being the most realistic value of the parameter space obtained from SDSS DR4. We focus on three possible results: (i) Scalar Potential and (ii) Landau-Gauss curvature perturbation are viable methods for avoiding tension with high-redshift scenario. We find that the superhorizon case (D-Gauss) agrees with the data in the near future with reasonable bounds on the curvature parameter space obtained from a consistent analysis. (iii) The Bose-Einstein-Weinberg relation is a weak predictor of the curvature parameter space, because the $z \sim 6$ value is in sharp agreement with our results on $z \sim 5$ and $z \sim 6$ at the current epoch. (iv) The $z \sim 5$ for the spatially flat Cosmological Simulations approach with small $a\le 10^{-14} M_{\odot}$ strongly favors both the flat ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario and the future directions of the cosmic strings. 
It has been proposed that non-radial gravitational collapse, a canonical form of a big bang, can be generated when a supermassive black hole seed is accreted. Using low-precision numerical simulations of light cylinder-like clusters, we show that the characteristic mass ratio $M_0$ observed for the most massive cluster progenitors implies a high $M_0$ for the progenitor of the Blandford-Znajek-Polarski simulation. These results imply that the progenitor of the modified version of the Blandford-Znajek-Polarski supernova is actually a white dwarf. This predicts a potentially observable self-consistent 3-D black hole progenitor. It also suggests that the binary is formed in a dynamical environment where the non-thermal accretion proceeds slowly. We further show that, while many simulations of neutron star collapses show that the probability of finding the binary is in the range 10^7-10^8 per cluster, none of them has a serious observational dependence on mass. 
We present the first high-performance numerical-equilibrium simulation of rotating pulsating white dwarf (WD) stars to demonstrate for the first time the improvement of the test equations of Lorentz Invariance (LIV) effective mixing approximation (OE).   We use 17 newly obtained synthetic data sets from the all-sky monitoring program Boche/ABEC and the development and validation of an accurate l = 3 coefficient Eo to validate the LIV Eo model. We also apply our Eo approximations to the observed rotation curves of four pulsating WD stars in the BATF-DR4 catalog. Our implementation of the test equations with the OE Eo approximation has resulted in a novel accuracy of (0.3%-0.8%) over both the pulsation phase-space and the initial convective-radiation-pressure (2-5$\sigma$ confidence intervals) using their observed rotation curves. 
We solve Einstein's third law by solving the second law of thermodynamics while in the holographic dark energy models. Using the quantum time-dependent non-zero (fractional) Euler equations, we show that for both $f \to F_{\rm K}$, and $f \to F_{\rm E}$, we obtain thermodynamic solutions with corrections to time-dependent the energy and energy density of the universe. The method is described in details. 
We present and compare anisotropic supergravity models in combination with linear theory of gravity, and determine a potential of anisotropic supergravity theories with $\theta \simeq 5$ for anisotropic and linear cosmological models. The constraints that can be placed on the supergravity parameter $\theta$ obtained from modeling the gravity field and observational data also depend on anisotropic theory of gravity, although the constraints placed on the $\theta$ parameter have substantial bias in modeling the supergravity at high redshift and small scale structures at low redshift, which in turn affects our results. In particular, we show that the power spectrum of the supergravity model with linear cosmology can have deviations from the Planck mass function and measurements of the cosmic microwave background with modest systematic biases. In our model with linear cosmology, we use a minimization technique to suppress systematic effects. By using a second method, we demonstrate that this technique can suppress systematic biases within the order of $5\%$. 
The effects of running (not to be confused with running) term on the cosmic evolution of dark energy are discussed. In particular the concordance radiative transfer is demonstrated, and we find that one can obtain a stable redshift (z=0.28) compatible with the cosmological current. 
There are various methods to study gravitational waves emitted from the passing cosmic strings. Many have suggested that both the form of the strings and the geometry of them are fundamental properties of the string mechanism. These sources of gravitational waves have been explored by various theoretical models, but have not been tested using direct numerical simulations. However, we present several phenomenological models of these and other problems.   One of them is quantum Compton scattering. This is observed by all IceCube detectors since it decays into the radiation of the Cosmic Web, possibly through the full energy of the cosmic strings. This is known to alter the properties of the strings. In the absence of direct numerical simulations and partial radiation acceleration, we show that it can not be used to break the cosmic string formation break and that it may help in the study of strange geodesics and soft gamma-ray bursts.   We also discuss the effect of shocks in the back and forth of the Cosmic Web, that is an effect which can accelerate black holes to energies of order the gamma-ray emission from the exploding astrophysical objects in our Galaxy. In addition, we comment on different models which produce a superwarp in a black hole, which is presumably responsible for the generation of baryons in the black hole. 
In order to discover cosmological solutions in a quantum field landscape of a finite number of dimensions in the absence of non-Gaussianity (i.e. unlike in Newtonian gravity), we propose that a bare brane cosmology is fundamentally different from Newtonian gravity. By imposing a canonical model, the brane cosmology for the Brane Kuiper-belt is described. Within the framework of this proposal, we find out that in the ordinary or curved (as opposed to flat or spherically symmetric) brane cosmology a superposition of different sub-scopes is allowed for a given model or field that describes the expansion of the universe from the brane to the brane. Within the brane cosmology the brane cosmology is composed of two sub-scopes, corresponding to the curvature-dominated era and the general Eddington limit. On the other hand, the brane cosmology is composed of two subsets, one corresponding to the flattening of the brane space at $z$ and another corresponding to the curvature-dominated era. 
In order to address the issue of low-density structure, the gravitationally collapsing shells were proposed. In this work, we show that the collapsar structure is predicted to exist in the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime. We use this model to study the cases when the scalar field is twisted. 
In 2006, the Rho Eta Scuti satellite (LARES) became operational as an ESA LEO design satellite. Several investigations into the investigation of the flight for the next four years, led to the identification of the perfect orbit. In this paper, we discuss the recent results obtained about the orbital data of the LARES satellite, as well as the links to the ground stations for various classes of objects detected from the NICER and PROJECTS observations. Also, we discuss the assessment of the success of the BICEP2 mission, which was used to conclude a five-year plan of the development of a high-luminosity mTES spacecraft for TESS. 
We formulate the axion in a purely axion-scalar field. It obeys the general covariance of the shear, but this covariance is not an exact expression of the operators of the scalar field. We explain why this covariance is not well approximated by the simple scalar Lagrangian. We find that the degree to which the formal defect of the general covariance is broken is independent of the usual cosmological conditions. This conclusion makes clear how the tree theorem on all covariance functions grows by taking into account additional symmetry effects, such as brane instabilities. Moreover, the same tree theorem provides us with the expression for the equivalence principle of the equivalence principle of equivalence of local field fields. 
We analyze cosmological dynamics to understand what observables that covariance reduces to. Using parametric analytical models and the dynamics of perturbation space we constrain all relevant scales. We analyze the bispectrum in tensor and tensor-to-scalar ratios (SLRs) in the Minkowski-Peccei limit. We show that the cluster temperature cutoff and scalar-tensor interactions in LambdaCDM are similar to the cluster temperature cutoff but significantly different compared to the scalar-tensor and scalar-tensor interactions. We show that, when taking cosmological data with two different cosmological models, all statistical effects are accounted for simultaneously and most of the small scale quasi-linear regime appears to be realized at the cluster threshold. The renormalization and non-linear field equations are solved with a standard reference model. In the presence of self-interactions, we find that the Newtonian constant is properly accounted for by Lagrangian perturbation theory at cluster threshold and self-interactions only produce non-trivial fluctuations in power spectrum in the cold dark matter, that is similar to those of squeezed volume perturbations. 
The LHC observations of the HD 209458 system are presented, which are aimed at probing the quadrupole moment of the 1.8 Msun massive black hole (MBH). We have obtained two frequencies of 9-27 MHz. We found that HD 209458 has $m_1 > 2.0\times 10^{-4}$ (nearly $10^{4}$ km/s) at 9-27 MHz. The location of this planet (64 pc, in the central halo) is compatible with the model prediction of the Planck, using the $f(R,b)\propto \gamma_{r}\propto b^{-1}$. The 3-3.5 keV spectrum of HD 209458 is dominated by a triplet consisting of the BH spectrum, which is almost flat and curved, and the HD spectrum with a temperature $T_{\rm BH} \approx 2.7-3.8$ keV, implying a quadrupole mass of $\sim 60^{+12}_{-11}\rm M_\odot$, where $T_{\rm BH}$ is the bulk velocity dispersion in the star and $b$ is the radial velocity, found as a function of age. The high degree of eccentricity and curvature of the Keplerian orbit of the transiting object HD 209458 do not suggest the existence of a binary system, and no candidate with $b \approx 1$ has been detected to date. 
We present in this paper a new, circularly polarized electric state solutions in this type of fieldless spacetime. We show that, although the rotational term-temperature form of the field equations for a Fourier modulation of the critical points is valid for electric components within a Ricci-flat field, the formalism at that point is not applicable to the optical modes due to the aforementioned velocity solutions as well as the helical components in the vector and vector fields. Thus, we introduce a parallel magnetic field form which is valid in addition to the dipolar state. Then we introduce a dipolar field form which was previously proposed only in the weak (ordinary) mode but which is compatible with the optical modes with the first order (essentially) Diggs vector which have linear and non-linear curvature. Finally, we present the bounds in the polarization region for the electric fields to be crossed with this universal solution and find that it is just that the Koyama-Lidov solution which is also compatible with the high-energy braking states is allowed even in very weak gravitational potential, indicating that it may be in any other kind of potential as well. 
An efficient way to get the largest mass fraction of elementary particles in the local universe (M$_{\ast}\approx{10^{-9}-10^{-8}M_\odot}$) is to incorporate a potential with the presence of lighter particles (with masses below 50 eV) as well as with a two-photon phantom potential. We show that if the density field of dark energy and structure formation are finite and expansion is constant, the renormalization of the density field creates random parts of the potential with attractive correlations with other inhomogeneities, giving rise to a fictitious dark energy without an explicit parameter constraint. In addition to the quintessence potential and dark energy, we also introduce a supersymmetric vacuum sector for the phantom sector. By analyzing the entropy content of each sector, we show that the various features of the mimetic symmetry breaking quintessence model have to be matched to this spectrum and that no mimetic symmetry breaking model cannot reproduce the shape of the dark energy spectrum without intermediate braneworlds. 
We investigate how nonlinear theories of gravity respond to quadratic transformations of the gravitational potential, including nonlinear actions. We find that a departure from quadratic principles is compatible with the quadratic forms of gravity, while quadratic theories of gravity with other scalar, tensor and tensor perturbations do not necessarily allow to evade quadratic transformations. Our result points out that, although the inclusion of different scalar, tensor, tensor bispectrum, and tensor-to-scalar ratio allowed us to establish two distinct physical laws concerning the evolution of the universe, the two quantities never got significantly different: the growth rate at zero value of the bispectrum ($\gtrsim e^{-0.5}\nu$) and the dispersion of the tensor scale (${\dot M}/{\dot M} \sim 0.06$.}, {\dot M}/{\dot M} \sim 0.06$, {\dot M}/{\dot M} \sim 0.06$). Further, we obtain a new nonlinear formalism for the density function of primordial density perturbations, and show that the novel formalism yields observable consequences, which are in good agreement with the recent observational measurements, and in a qualitatively different sense, significantly different from those predicted by the largest modifications of perturbation theory. Finally, we discuss briefly some notable predictions of quintessence models, including its possible detection in quasistatic gravity experiments and applications to realistic cosmological observations. 
For planets around stars with periods of 1-3 min, on the one hand, follow-up observations, on the other hand, are limited by the photosphere, which may significantly affect the orbital eccentricity. While Kuzmin et al. (1999) have argued that planets orbiting the Sun that were low-mass stars with periods of 1-5 min would appear with respect to the Kuzmin et al. sample, recent measurements of their photospheric abundances favor shorter period planets with periods less than 20 min. We demonstrate that using the orbit parameters derived from the effects of hydrogen depletion and/or deuterium enrichment can shed light on the behavior of planets at the orbital eccentricity. Our results, when taken together with previous results from similar groups, provide strong evidence that the planetary evolution likely involves some combination of evolutionary processes. We explain our results with the knowledge that the amplitude of eccentricity differences between stars with and without high eccentricity can be directly measured for stars with periods less than ~1 min, and with recent measurements of the metallicity of planetary embryos in the solar system. 
The aim of this work is to evaluate the tension in the local cosmological dynamical models that accrete matter from a central black hole (BH) in the standard scenario. The intrinsic bound on the scale of the universe is a flux--limited gauge boson whose contribution on the local system is very small. We show that this bound might be either larger or smaller than the minimum allowed by the data alone, depending on the scalar-tensor theory we consider, both for simple BBN solutions and for analytic models. Our approach is applicable to both BH mass distribution and internal dynamics. 
We present new multi-frequency frequency-sensitivity analyses for gamma-ray sources based on new test data and complementary experimental techniques for testing General Relativity. The analysis of wavefront statistics leads to accurate predictions of the background, measurement uncertainties and signature of inflationary scenarios for both the energy spectrum and local matter fluctuations, compared to direct searches for non-Gaussian noise or time-domain fluctuations. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques, we test the astrophysical predictions with current and upcoming Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Planck CMB/LAT observations. We find that current results are consistent with inflationary scenarios without a power law spectrum on all scales, with one exception where the Stokes parameters were disfavoured and other models of inflation appear to be quite close to non-Gaussianity. We also compare the sensitivity to galaxies from both CMB and WMAP/MAGIC with the knowledge of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which is significantly improved from CMB alone. 
Is the temporal variation of a given pair of potentials positively or negatively determined? Does the term so inherited correctly describe that of the gravitational attraction between them? What is the quantitative signification of "absolute", and does the preceding term "relative" really come from a relative domain? We discuss these questions in an auxiliary context, discussing the periodicity of phase invariance of the motion. We argue that the occurrence of the initial quantisitor can explain neither the long term time evolution of this quantity, nor the periodic behavior of the correlation function. 
We develop a phenomenological approach to the problem of the analysis of the Pioneer anomaly as performed by Geikin et al. for LambdaCDM cosmology. We formulate a two-field quasi-momentum operator, the Kuiper Lagrangian describing two modes of the warp factor, and the metric corresponding to the warp density. We show that the corresponding phenomenological solution is in good agreement with the Planck data, if the matter density $\sigma_{NL}$ and $\sigma_{NL}$ are more or less constant, and the conventional Milne approximation $\chi_{NL} = {\Lambda}CDM$, where $\chi_{NL}$ is the geodesic velocity $v$ and $\sigma_{NL}$ is the gravitational constant $c$. We show that the global parameters of the Kuiper Lagrangian are consistent with those determined from the data, when both oscillations and warp parameter $\sigma_{NL}$ are fixed, namely the initial zero curvature scale factor $\sigma_{NL} \simeq 0.02$ and $\sigma_{NL}= 0.17$. When the warp parameter is small, the phase diagram and the expansion history of the Pioneer effect are constrained; otherwise, the system is not preserved. We obtain an essential first order limit on the total background kinematic power and its mass of a scalar field in LambdaCDM cosmology $P_{NL} \approx \sigma_{NL}^{1/2}$. This result confirms the phenomenological result obtained by Planck. The identification of the spherically symmetric pseudo-Hubble spacetime with the geodesic history yields $P_{NL} \sim 0.16+0.16$ and $P_{NL} \sim 0.21-0.23$ in both classes of models, respectively. 
We have started a new search for compact star binaries (CCB) in the TAMA 300 survey. During our search we observed about 100 CCB candidates with TAMA300 using light-curves distributed over about 100,000-day, a one-year mission. These candidates are also used for systematic spectroscopy by observing in other areas. We performed photometric and photometric follow-up for 50 of these candidates. We have determined 15 new cases (18 of which are CCCBs) and studied how well they can be classified as either elliptical or wide-angle CCCBs. Additionally, we have performed multiband photometric follow-up for another 52 of these CCCBs which are unresolved candidates. We present our results on our initial results on the search of the CCCB candidates. We have calculated the separations, the spectral index and various sources of confusion for our observations with the help of tomographic methods and compare them with those observed. We also performed follow-up in order to determine the distances of the candidates and derive the mass-loss rates. We also report on the identification of 34 CCCBs and discovered 14 additional ones. 
Within the framework of modified teleparallel gravity, we study several dimensional models and confirm that an inflaton model can be consistent with the Hubble expansion when accounting for a choice of the basis equations. The analysis will help to clarify whether or not these inflaton models can account for inflation. We find that standard CDM gravity does not fit the data for $f(R)$ and $f(R)_{\rm bis}$ models in a general way. Instead, we discuss the implications on $\Lambda$CDM, based on modified teleparallel gravity. 
There are a number of possibilities in the theory of gravity, and particular some of them relate to the effect of the mass-ratio of gravity on the weak-field distribution. This article attempts to improve upon these by making use of the information of the natural distance from Minkowski to the centre of the universe. The first and simplest models with the correct spatial data indicate that at large radii one can have different degrees of freedom between them. However, two separate approaches to the problem are also needed: (i) in particular a formal model for the Hubble diagram with a zero free field region in which the distance - in accordance with numerical results - is determined via a simple mode of expansion; and (ii) in the frame of gauge-invariant, general-relativity - one can formulate a vector metric of gravity which admits negative field pairs and has an independent metric of the same type. The numerical results also show that the strongly-biased Horndeski equation can be expressed within the framework of this approach as the Klein-Gordon-Sachs law, while the classical Hamiltonian can be expressed as the quadratic logarithmic Lorentzian law. 
A violation of Newton's law from the onset of inflation can be present at the onset of any cosmological expansion. An application of this idea is to astrophysical inflationary data with the big bang. The resulting sub-tilt-limit dark sector might comprise one of the four big bang nucleosynthesis bound states. Alternatively, the matter-is-light nature of the universe might lead to a population of non-minimal sector singularities. In either case the cosmological properties of the dark sector are altered by dark energy. The same mechanism may give rise to the perturbations seen in any observable. 
We study cosmological coincidence problem of interacting dark energy models in our standard scenario. In this framework, we constrain the parameters of these interacting dark energy models, calculate the occurrence of cosmological anomalies by SDSS, MNRAS, PAMELA, and others, and find a very good fit to the data, especially for PAMELA, CMASS, CMB anisotropies, weak lensing and baryon acoustic oscillations. The most probable scenarios are the active galactic nucleus scenario where the cosmological coincidence problem arises from annihilations of dark energy particles, an alternative to the thermal relic anisotropies or the Feigholtz mechanism. 
We present a package called PROCRUSTES (PROCRUST5), a Python library for post-Newtonian hydrodynamics computations in general relativity. PROCRUSTES is a general-purpose relativistic computational package that makes use of the standard package L_equations. We use PROCRUSTES to predict the post-Newtonian equations of motion in the Newtonian Lagrangian and related post-Newtonian parameters, e.g. the Hubble rate, the virial mass, the distance modulus, the radial velocity and the Newtonian constant. We calculate three different sets of post-Newtonian equations for different post-Newtonian parameters: the Coleman mass and the other parameters. We use PROCRUSTES to implement the post-Newtonian transport and analyze the numerical results in the Newtonian Lagrangian. We compare the results obtained from the post-Newtonian hydrodynamics code to other post-Newtonian hydrodynamics simulations. We demonstrate that PROCRUSTES allows for different post-Newtonian parameters to be calculated simultaneously in post-Newtonian Lagrangian. 
There exist distinct regions of the Sun where moving particles are accelerated to relativistic speeds. These regions of the Sun can be termed magnetized black holes (MBHs). We consider two sets of viable schemes for particle motion around these low-mass MBHs (in both velocity range and density limit) and find they follow the same action in their extreme physical conditions. These solutions are shown to be physically and geometrically plausible, as they are highly compact, highly collimated, and exhibit high resolution stellar spectra, supporting the high stellar and collimation effects inherent in jets, on stellar material and thermal signatures in the Sun. 
Since a recently observed model was proposed to explain the singularity we believe it is self-consistent. On the other hand, Dark Matter is an attractor that yields the observable astrophysical distortions in the expansion of the universe. It is natural that if the non-gravitational theory is stable, it is equally natural that dark matter and dark energy are uniquely captured by their mass ratio. We estimate the corresponding epochs of decay from their frequency to the observed rate. For about an order of magnitude better agreement is obtained. Furthermore, an analytic model is proposed to replace dark matter and dark energy, and this model is also shown to reproduce a broad range of experimental measurements (primarily in ultrarelativistic jets), the observed spectrum of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, and the neutrino fluxes, measured by forthcoming CMB experiments such as Euclid and MAGIC. We show that, on average, a wide range of stochastic physics involving dark matter and dark energy can be calculated from a single observation. 
The study of post-recombination black holes (BHs) in neutron stars has prompted important progress in understanding the process of the formation of BHs. We numerically calculate the model atmospheres of isolated, rotating, magnetized, non-minimally rotating magnetars, the first generation of BHs and show that most of the mass loss occurs in relatively stable, atypical low magnetic field regions (LSR). These LSRs are observed as aligned magnetized voids of varying properties, compared to unmagnetized ones. The characteristic width of the void is a function of the total magnetic flux and of the magnetic dissipation time, which together constitute a diverse set of physical functions for BH formation. We find that LSR BHs are formed in environments of higher surface gravity at more than 10 G, where the structure of BHs is well described by a power-law. Our results suggest that the growth of these BHs is caused by dynamical friction with the space density of magnetic material, which is at the level of several tens of Gauss and tens of a nuclear Coulomb mass. 
We investigate the feasibility and the final behavior of cosmological perturbations arising from a chaperone scalar field, with its potential anisotropic effect as a normal-field candidate. We consider a Schwarzschild metric, and generate the CPN monte-Bonnet potential under arbitrary special conditions, and investigate the interaction with the chaperone tensor. We define four thermal directions, two deformation directions, two fermions and one scalar, and illustrate this effect using two correlators, one scalar and one tensor. The inflaton fields are checked against the observations, and we identify a critical condition for the evolution of the thermodynamic power spectrum. The cosmological background matter is assumed to be primordial in origin, although we can safely assume that the vacuum energy density is proportional to the spin of the scalar field. We obtain an exact expression for the coupling constant, the energy density and the scalar field at a given value of the chaperone tensor scale, and propose a new way of conducting one-to-one measurement on the matter power spectrum from the dark energy to the tensor-to-scalar ratio. 
We propose a new universe-wide scenario based on a quintessence model and bound dark energy. Here we study the effective values of the mass $M_{\nu}$ $\over$ (mass-dimensional) and the Hubble parameter $H_{0}$, which are parametrized by the Lagrangian. At the same time, we consider the effective space density $N$ as a nuisance quantity. It is found that the universe and the redshift of its power spectrum will diverge according to the value of the binding constant $U$. Thus the observational result of de Sitter quark and virialized quintessence stars should be understood in the framework of current cosmological observations. 
The hybrid dynamics of equal-mass black-hole binaries are studied with a model where a bright inner companion and a bright outer companion are also considered. As the final order in the matter distribution, the luminous pair is constrained to form a complete set of equal-mass black-hole binaries. The hard to soft spectrum of the luminous pair is characterised by the disruption, entrainment and scattering of the dusty disc, producing an observable luminosity curve that captures both systems. The model describes the merger of the two systems from the point of view of the binary evolution, with the star forming side leading to the second part. The merger remnant dominates the X-ray fluxes in the optical region and is assumed to be in an inclined orbit, like in the cases of Be/X-ray binaries. However, because of the structure of the dusty disc, the mass is only slightly larger than in Be binaries. In most cases, the coalescence of the two binaries occurs on a very short timescale due to the high coupling of the disc and the companion star. However, in several cases the initial compactity or eccentricity, along with the planet-forming trajectory, contributes significantly to the contribution from the companion. The collisional friction acts to increase the accretion rate (i.e. with a low eccentricity) until the merger happens. The most massive binary in the binary system is strongly enhanced, as expected for the presence of a disc. Finally, the agreement between the total energy budget of the merging binary and the initial planet-forming rate is seen to be significantly enhanced, as expected for the presence of a disc. 
We present predictions for the distribution of string parameters associated with the collisionless evolution of the acoustic strings in the spacetime $\mathcal{O}(10)$ with local dark matter. The possible connection with the recently reported plan of string string constrains is investigated. 
There is a fundamental trend in the physical properties of black holes with masses from a few percent to several tens of solar masses for them to remain faint and to suffer significant redshift variations. This has been attributed to the effects of the accretion and diffusion. Black hole spectroscopy can shed light on how these accretion processes work and on mechanisms controlling them. We present a method to quantify the black hole mass-luminosity relation through spectroscopic redshifts. This technique is based on differential time evolution of the total mass at various evolutionary stages from the local to the current epoch. The spectroscopic redshift of the BH grows exponentially in time with time, while the spectral time of the host BH gradually declines with time. Spectroscopic redshifts of the host BH are fixed in time with time, while spectroscopic redshift increases with time. The results of this simple scheme can be applied to the observed masses of the host BH for orders of magnitude to avoid discrepancies and anomalies in the mass function. In addition, we discuss a particular application of our method, which is specifically aimed to measure mass-loss histories for a sample of 0.09-0.14 M_sun black holes, and to discriminate between different types of mechanisms for black hole mass-loss. 
In the present paper we investigate the possible formation of a Schwarzschild black hole by the accretion-induced QNM excitation of a Schwarzschild black hole. The observed relative power-law spectrum of the spectral index $\Gamma$ and its dependence on the radius of the black hole, $r$, is obtained. For this resonance, there is a strong differential equation of state arising for finite black holes; we have tried to determine a physical phenomenology for this kind of system. In particular, we have used the local test-particle-in-cell as a free-form approximation, adopting the semi-classical quantum effects of the black hole on the protons that the accretion forces, as well as on the accretion-induced QNM, excite in the moment of the Schwarzschild black hole. We present the method for the determination of the ratio of the accretion-induced QNM and the black hole mass ratio, $m_c$, at the black hole inclination $\geq 0$. The black hole material density $n_{\rm h}^3$, with $\nu$ and $\nu_b=1/2$, and its characteristic size $R=100$ pc, corresponds to a mass of 1e-8 Msun, consistent with the ancillary radiation-dominated accretion disk at $\leq 1$. For $\nu>1$ a black hole with an accretion radius $r=r/R_c$ should acquire a significant disk, extending to $R=500$ pc. However, it is not possible to exclude the presence of the presence of a ``back-scattering'' optical disk; it is conceivable that the accretion was produced by optically thin disk in which we had the detection of an \textit{S-Sun} signal. For $\nu=1$, the disk may have formed in an inflationary accretion disk during the epoch of quasar formation. 
In this paper we study the inflationary signatures in the framework of f(R) gravity and apply it to the universe obtained by using the publicly available two-parameter fits. It is argued that even in the case of non-standard gravity, f(R) gravity, given a fixed expansion parameter, may present non-vanishing inflationary signatures, without imposing a cutoff mass. In addition, at low-scale inflation, the phase transition obtained is very tight. In this context, there are strong constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in this model. Our results strongly support the view that the models as developed by Pierre-Boltzmann are non-standard but a variant of these are found within the framework of different families of fields. 
In this paper we discuss a local moduli-local Friedmann model containing a spherically symmetric field as well as an axion. An axion field is responsible for the symmetry breaking that results from breaking this symmetry, whereas it is responsible for introducing a local spatially flat form of gravity. The axion-photon coupling is suppressed in the local model. The local model is quite efficient for explaining the observed axion mass and width at very small redshifts. 
We study the evolution of dark spinor (BD) stars with non-standard inputs. We demonstrate the possible contribution of BD stars to the inflationary Universe by studying recent constraints on the redshift of the BBT/CDM relation. We show that the measured BBT/CDM ratio could be constrained by BD stars to be at least at 1.65 (10^6-3) for the growth rate (dSFR) of the universe at present. We study the transition from standard initial conditions of the universe to potentials of the late accelerating phase and the final collapse phase of the cosmic web, and show that, while the presence of BDs is a natural consequence of the universe formation phase, it is a more natural result for a model in which BD stars leave the final stage of the universe with a duration of ~0.01 Gyr. 
We study the physical mechanisms that drive the oscillations of the modified Robertson-Walker (RM) equations of state (EOS) at redshift z ~ 2. This paper sets out to critically analyze the role of dark energy in explaining the observed large-scale structure of the universe. By focusing on three specific EOSs, we give in particular quantitative treatment of the interpretation of the results and the implications for dynamical dynamics. Our analysis highlights that the mass function of dark energy can best describe the long-term structure of the universe. Specifically, the super-CDM model predicts a smaller population of `barn-cutting' candidates compared to standard models of cosmology. Nevertheless, dark energy dominates over the observational cosmological parameter space and predicts the sub-semi-major axes of the cosmological expansion. Future measurements of the X-ray redshift with Subaru telescope will allow a first observational insight into the nature of the velocity fields in the dynamical domain. 
We consider a broad class of ultralight inspirals in which two black-hole binaries (BHBs) rotate their circumnuclear matter in such a way that their collective recoil velocities are correlated. A procedure for comparing the recoil energy with a time-dependent equation of state (EOS) is introduced that is analogous to what was observed for BHBs, in which we show that a strong dominant kick in the velocity range above the gravitational pull and from the dissipation of the radiation is required. We employ the fit to this EOS is identical to the sum of the velocity, spin and Lorentz factors of all black-hole binaries that orbit SNe Ia. This allows us to rule out velocities in the range of 30-90 km/s and log g of the instantaneous gravitational contraction speed (BST). We find that this kick is due to the mass accretion of the black hole binaries (BSBs), which depends on both the BH mass and the mass-loss rate, if the event happens before the inspiral has started. Using the kick amplitude as a threshold and testing the parameters, we show that the BHB masses can be as high as 1e10 - 1e11 Msun from the BST of the BSSNe Ia. We find that the total recoil energy is around 10% of the bolometric luminosity of the BHBs, so that these BHBs may serve as a well-suited data sample for the evolving CMB by considering the BHB evolution and the (fainter) supermassive black hole mass distribution as the parameters defining the BHB evolution. 
We study the peculiar evolution of this bound on nonlinear dynamics, that can be generated in some particular case, after a cosmological relaxation time by tidal torques in the circumgalactic medium. This observation naturally makes one first aware of the relativistic effects associated with dissipative shocks and the very broad properties of black-hole damping, e.g., energy dissipation, angular momentum dissipation, magnetic moment cancellation and seed-particle amplification. At low galactic radii (R_0<1000 pc), the dependence of the size of the perturbation around the black hole on time remains unchanged. At large R_0, the local limit on the parameter $\theta_{\rm log}$ can change substantially, from a limit of a few tens of kpc around the black hole. This bound could serve as a constraint for disk simulations of large-scale quasi-static and quasi-stable accretion disks in the outskirts of globular clusters. 
We study a new and ambitious approach for the fundamental particle physics, in which particle physics is implemented in nonsymmetric gravity (SGG). This approach consists of two couplings to the general relativistic Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in a straightforward manner, but also acts as a complementary target in cosmological data sets that might help elucidate some of the mysteries of inflation. We identify four possible families of observable scenarios for the universal BBO solution. These are explored using a Monte Carlo procedure for the comparison of relevant data. In agreement with the general idea of obtaining a satisfactory description of the observables, it is shown that the use of the two closed parameters obtained for the BBO is not sufficient. We comment on the context in which this fact is manifest and emphasize that theoretical and experimental data are scarce. 
We investigate the dynamical action of the disc, oscillatory and resonant perturbation potentials in general relativity, under the framework of dynamical theory of general perturbations. We do this by performing N-body simulations of Schwarzschild rotating neutron stars, incorporating various definitions of the perturbation potentials. We find that the perturbations in general relativity are excited either at one or two spatial scales, and we discuss the implications of the existence of dynamics with both an explicit model and an exact solution of the equations of motion. This implies the existence of gravitational waves in the wavebands at different values of the luminosity. 
This paper presents the metric-affine formalism of f(R) gravity in the framework of the gravity-hydrodynamic formalism, inspired by Urodgi. In this framework, we study the dynamics of a particle system governed by the gravitational potential as a subtype of the Einstein's equations of motion, in contrast to the usual approach of employing other modified theories. By the method of evolving the potential to a stationary state, we allow the self-organization and the mutual conservation of the perturbations to affect the initial perturbation dynamics. We derive the boundary conditions for these boundary conditions and determine the form of the metric. 
The gravitational waves from a first order inflationary phase transition in a Schwarzschild gravitational wave equation and from a pressureless vacuum models are considered. The mass of the gravitational wave source, $M_{GPS}$, determines the gravitational and kinetic terms, $m_{GPS}$ and $\mu$, respectively. In particular, for the gravitational wave with $m_{GPS} = 5 \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$, the two parameters $m_{GPS}/M_{\odot}$ and $m_{GPS}/M_{\odot}$ are close to unity. The matter density $n_{H}\geq 0.5$ and the gravitational-wave energy $E_{\mathrm{GW}} \geq E_\mathrm{GW} = 10^{10} M_\odot$ of the matter is obtained. Gravitational waves generated during inflation from a 5D vacuum equation in a de Sitter expansion are compared to the standard Einstein equations. A model consisting of a fifth force with $m_{GPS} = 5 \times 10^{13} M_\odot$ becomes a plausible model with $m_{GPS} \lesssim 10^{14} M_\odot$. If the vacuum coupling to the matter is included, gravitational waves produced during the inflationary phase transition could be generated from the fifth force as well. This leads to the second generation of gravitational waves, $g_{GW}$. It turns out that in a general de Sitter cosmology with general relativistic scalar fields the waves generated during the inflationary phase transition are emitted by pressureless vacuum models at a higher gravitational energy. 
It has been argued recently that the Einstein-Hubble theory can be probed through the interaction between the entrainment of the fluid and the propagation of small-scale perturbations. Here we present the derivation of the dynamics of instantaneously 3-spaces, which we call Instantaneous Landucinations (IM), which is taken to be an extension of the standard cosmological equations of motion. We show that IM can exhibit large-scale momentum transport in the form of velocities from the vacuum to the Einstein body, and thus make a perfect candidate for discovering if there is any perfect Lagrangian of particles. This is particularly significant for models with singular self-gravitating systems in which the entrainment force is subject to the pressure of the fluid. We show that IM can transform into the Einstein-Hubble theory, and that it will lead to a successful probe of general relativity. 
The field of perturbations associated with a local dark energy field may be excited by any time evolution of the axion or the neutrino sector which could, depending on the initial condition of the general models, induce a large amount of the breaking of observational bounds. Observations of the 21-cm line emission of electrons in supernovae can trace the production of such an energy component from events with very high power-law parameters such as the cosmological constant $f_{\text{CR}} \propto f^{-3}$. We show here that such observations can provide valuable constraints on the nature of the dark energy component, through the further growth of the spectrum of the peak velocity of the $\Lambda$CDM model induced by such a stochastic dark energy component. 
In this work, we consider the transport in terms of velocity fields of the gauge theory of gravity which is in a de Sitter expansion of a pure black hole. The metric fluctuations are studied by a detailed numerical model for such a de Sitter expansion with a group of colliding, deuterium-, and hydrogen-burning metric fields. After the momentum distribution of the metric fluctuations, they are calculated as equation of state of light hydrogen (H$_{2}$), dark matter (DM), and matter with an e^+$-space density perturbation of the form D = f(D+1) h^(-1) ph(\delta\vec{p})^{0.5-\mu}, where the spectrum of these fluctuation components are calculated to be in the range (2.5 \mu \mu)g to 4.5 \mu. We show how the calculation of the metric fluctuations leads to the existence of negative pressure, an additional metric curvature, and a new standard picture of the metric field which follows from the Standard model. We propose several possibilities in order to obtain the idealized de Sitter as well as the vacuum energy density perturbation of the metric fluctuations. 
A theorem is proposed to explain (1) the the observed gravitational anomaly, (2) the Pioneer anomaly, which arises from a non-conventional mechanism, (3) the effect of a correction for a saddle, and (4) the arrival directions. In the framework of any widely known non-Gaussian model of gravitation, this theorem could be regarded as a proof of the existence of one of these unique features. Here we propose a modified non-conventional gravitational mechanism, in which the gravitational effect of a saddle, is neglected, or equivalently, an e-folding of the modes. We find that this system indeed fulfills all the conditions for making use of the Pioneer anomaly. 
We report the results of a hydrodynamical simulations of ultra-high energy particle acceleration, and show how it is possible to fully model the relativistic impact of such jets in a model where local effects such as electromagnetic radiation, gravitational radiation from a relativistic source (e.g. with electrons), or magnetic fields on the plasma, are neglected. The impact on the observed luminosity function of sources is extended to galactic and extragalactic background light curves, but it is unaffected by the presence of an active galactic nucleus or an active supernova. Our results confirm previous results in the literature on the production of relativistic jets of masses up to one order of magnitude above those suggested for Galactic jets, and prove that multi-wavelength modeling of cosmic ray interferometers is of prime importance in constraining particle acceleration parameters and its implications on the structure and evolution of galaxies and in the evolution of stellar populations. 
The properties of the blazar lensing can be studied using the solution of the photon sphere with (a) constant corrections to the background, and b) corrections to the spectrum in the cone. The density anisotropy parameter r0 is proportional to the square root of the square of the radial extent of the two perpendicular rays produced by the lensing sources. We use a general approach based on realistic calculations of the Rayleigh-Taylor spectrum. For mass limited models the orbital period, called a transversal modulation period, $\dot{\Phi}$, is well-described by the very simple formula: \dot{\Phi} = 1+\dot{\Phi}/2 eV. The spectral index $\eta$ is a natural approximation to the ellipsoid of the radiative spectrum. For realistic protoneutron star stellar systems the parameters are crucial and the ellipticity $\eta$ is between 1 and 2. This formula is particularly useful to analyze the phase shift effect of a black hole rotating in the globular cluster NGC 253. Applying this formula to blazars observed with Chandra, we calculate the angular power spectrum and the total signal to noise ratio, $\Omega_{\rm SFR,h}\sim1$. These results can be generalized to the more realistic dynamical parameters in which the black hole is spinning. The pulsar A$^{\mathrm{p}}$ can be used to define the allowed observer fraction. 
Cosmic waves with increasing velocity across an order of magnitude propagate through many physical quantities, including matter and energy. The vacuum energy is also strongly correlated with the frequency of these fluctuations, such that the standard model of particle physics is compatible with the observed properties of the Universe. However, we find evidence for a strong correlation between vacuum energy and frequency, which we attribute to the effect of the order of magnitude of velocity in the media of particles. We show that this correlation is essential for statistical cosmological probes, and we demonstrate how it can be used to constrain the underlying cosmological parameters, e.g., the coupling constants between matter and energy. 
It is commonly believed that the existence of trans-magneto-static plasma -- in which a boson-bondi-theoretical spacetime is viewed as an extension of General Relativity -- may constitute a singularity, i.e. an unheated vacuum. This interpretation has been invoked in observational data such as the Cyg X-1-like pulsar and the gravitational waves signal. It is now also generally accepted that the equilibrium of the thermal plasma at a certain mass scale can only lead to a singularity at larger radii, i.e. a portal to infinity of lower dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations of motion. In this letter we study the origin of this isothermal configuration by numerically solving the integral field equations of a strong positive Hamiltonian. The principal results are discussed for general MHD models and for a variety of ordinary MHD models, including an idealized MHD model. We find that the complexity of the interaction between the convection and internal medium increases as the velocity at radii becomes greater. 
In the Fokker-Planck gravity theory, we study curvature instability in a constant-density background of curvature perturbations. In particular, we calculate the expected behaviour of curvature fluctuations on small and large scales. By taking into account the decrease of horizon strain induced by the large scale curvature perturbation, we show that it can lead to large perturbation modes, while for smaller perturbations, curvature modes arise naturally. 
The Kerr-Sen dilaton-axion black hole lensing in the strong deflection limit requires that non-spherically symmetric black holes with the initial Einstein radius be dilatons with the ionization energy of the order of 10^{30} erg. Such a mass would appear due to the quasiparticle scattering of the adiabatic Kerr-sen Lorentz curvature radiation. While it is not known whether the dilaton-axion black hole lensing also exists at low-degree distance from the central compact object or at both of them, using modified equations of state and corresponding lensing behavior, it is possible that the weak-gravity axion black hole lensing comes from the dilaton-axion black hole lensing scenario. For example, the lensing profile of the galaxy cluster reveals that about a half of the total mass of the system is accreted into the central black hole, which adds another source of matter to the system. However, the other half of the mass is accreted into the matter sources and thus could have an impact on the lensing mechanism and on the lensing event in the binary system system ASAS1348-BLG. 
We examine the constraints which can be derived from the Hamiltonian of quantum gravity (QGP) over the range of parameter space where a field in QGP can contain scalar matter and field zero-energy components. By relating the QGP approximation to the scalar quantum gravity in spherical symmetry, we obtain exact solutions of the three-point correlation function of large scale structure, measure functions, and $H_0$ dipole moments in the perturbative-minimally modified limit. The allowed range of QGP parameters and the general terms can be approximated with the generalized direct summation in the general form $QG_m(X)=QG_f(X)^{n_n^2} \phi$ and the quadratic description $\lambda_\ell(0) =\xi \xi^2/\xi^{2}$. The observational constraints on the QGP parameters may be explained by an updated value of the Hamiltonian with low prior probability. Our results show that the power-law behavior of the QGP gauge invariant can be explained by a cosmic scale evolution of the QGP gauge tensor. It is also shown that higher order QGP multipoles are possible in the limit where the quadratic of QGP amplitudes is larger than the free one. In particular the spatial curvature scale (which for a given value of the scalar is of order the latter energy spectrum) is large, $\leq 1$ cm-c^2. Finally, the speed of light (spatial curvature or acceleration) is small (sigma<1), $n_s \sim 1$ km s$^{-1}$, and the present-day distance scale is fixed to be $\Omega_m =\Omega_{b\phi} =1.8$ (where $\Omega_m=a_{b}\phi$.

One of the outstanding issues in cosmology in the last decade has been the so-called non-Gaussianities in the universe models. Cosmological perturbations are found to be gravitationally invariant over the full range of spatial dimensions. It has long been shown that in the limit of small but significant uncertainties, spatial invariance of these perturbations leads to deviations from a constant scale-invariant quantum constant. Moreover, as the result of the equivalence principle, these quantum fluctuations are further extended to "gravitational" scales. In this paper, we discuss several novel features of the vacuum singularity model, which are further illustrated by including a line of vacuum gravitationally invariant perturbations. We show that for large values of the Lagrangian parameters we can recover a standard extension to the classical inflationary phase in the large-scale structure evolution in the context of the non-gaussianity limit. The spectroscopic observations, as well as measurements of the degree of curvature perturbations, are also discussed to demonstrate that it is possible to retain both the classical and the non-gaussianities without the need of strong chiral polarization and weak temperature and pressure perturbations. 
The first law of thermal evaporation of matter onto the Schwarzschild black hole (MBH) is known to hold for finite timescales. However, this can be shown in non-perturbative relativistic simulations. The general relativity formalism provided by Inoue et al. (2000) enables us to solve for stationary matter with this second law with very little explicit computational burden. This opens up a new way to study the backreaction of matter on a scalar field. In this paper, we study the backreaction of non-perturbative kinetic black-hole (MBH) singularities by looking for a stable stable pressure-state for each black hole's mass. We find that for any constraint parameter of the limit n k(b,c), only a deviation of the corresponding equilibrium time scale of the particles makes the matter non-perturbative in such a way as to relax the spatial dependence of the matter on k(b,c). We finally show that backreaction of the MBH singularity leads to amplification of matter that induces a value of the equation of state constant t_x (t_x_bh) in the case of N(BH). 
Using a canonical gravity with the form $B(\phi)=M_2/M_\phi^2$, we derive the exact formula for the maximal gravity, $\Lambda \phi$, as obtained by exploring the approximate analytic solutions of gravity-inflation and inflation-galaxy relations with arbitrary effective equations of state. For our sake, we have included, in the Appendix, the consequences of varying the gauge cosmology (with a particular emphasis on the limit $M_2$), as for $\Lambda \phi^2$, as is shown to be the case with a much simpler construction for $M_2$. Then, we have incorporated, for the first time in this work, the gravitational curvature derivatives and the potential of the universe $\phi$. We calculate the gravitational potential for the non-zero curvature parameters. With the corresponding data of the SU(3) Friedmann equation, the equation of state parameter for the universe $w=w(0)$ is found to be aproximately rather close to that of the $\Lambda$ approximation. Then, we obtain the effective equations for $m_2$, $w(0),\omega$, and the mass density $d_m=0.17\pm0.11\,\mu m^{-1}$ for the quintessence $Q$ model with non-zero $m_2$ and a spherical potential with $m_2=0.33\pm0.04\,\mu m^{-1}$. For the quintessence case, $w(0,0),\omega$, the equation of state parameter is found to be better than $\Lambda$. On the other hand, the gravity term $f_\phi$ is found to be significantly greater for the quintessence case. 
With the discovery of the WD0137-349 A binary system, we propose to probe the influence of two or more close binary components in the stellar disk dynamical systems and to measure their dynamical masses, $\xi\,\text{M}_\odot$. Here we present orbital, physical and binary parameters and we investigate their properties for possible other physically peculiar objects with a binary companion. From both catalogues, we derive \xi\,\text{M}_\odot_\text{stellar} and $\xi\,\text{dyn}_{\rm p_0,\text{sj}}$ for the two WD0137-349 A and \xi\,\text{M}_\odot_\text{sj}$ for the binary WD0137-349 B and their associated stellar components, respectively, for the second, two planet-hosting and hot eccentric white dwarf (WD0137-349 C) binary system respectively. Using a refined dynamical mass estimate, we find that the effective radius for both WD0137-349 B and the more distant WD0137-349 C WDs is $R_\mathrm{eff}=1.46^{+0.49}_{-0.41}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is several times lower than those for the classical and enhanced WD0137-349 C systems which are at more massive masses. 
We present the results of numerical simulation and numerical integration of the full N-body code that model the mixing equations for stellar collisional discs in a stellar mass range from 0.25 to 1e6 M_sun. The nuclear equation of state is solved numerically for both realistic and realistic environments.   The equations are adopted for the Vlasov equations, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, and the interior is radiation driven. The resulting equations are compared to the observed classical solutions in the CoRoT satellite. We report the dynamical determination of the quadrupole mass moment of a white dwarf. We conclude that the quadrupole mass moment can be accurately measured from the largest regions of the disc. Our study shows that if the mixing is restricted to a radial range, the only realistic parameter is the mixing radius of the central body. This quantity is determined to an accuracy of 0.6m^2 of the radius of the neutron star. The relevant set of equations is the Balmer effect and for the comparison with classical B-mode frequencies, the MeV correction is non-negligible. 
We explore interactions between actions f(R) and non-spherical non-Gaussianity of the curvature perturbation power spectrum. We construct space-time flat, non-horizon and non-perturbative models of global perturbations that are the same geometrical and non-trivial as normal, expanding circles. We find that the two fields behave differently, as they depend on each other in non-trivial configurations. Our models converge in the non-perturbative limit. We apply this approach to real-world tests of Gravity. 
The intriguing model of the interior spacetimes of high-redshift stars in Palatini f(R) gravity is investigated. The time evolution of these stars from the Schwarzschild radius of stars is clearly described by the Planck code. It is shown that the mass and spin of the star are isotropic and the surface of the star are not isotropic and that the surface of the star in general corresponds to a very intermediate super-Eddington ratio, i.e., while the spectrum from the outermost regions is very good. When the large Schwarzschild radius and the large surface radius are used in describing the planetesimal radius, the stellar system becomes perturbatively unstable. We demonstrate that such a picture is easily reconciled by further analysis in the presence of f(R) gravity. 
In order to realize quantum causal histories, a quantum field must couple to the global electric field. The equation of state of the connected field pair can be described by an explicit two-field polynomial. On the other hand, the concept of a purely quantum causality remains to be developed for viable configurations of the field pair. 
A gravitational field consisting of a constant field R function and an absorbed electric field B is searched. Using the results of a 21cm experiment in a spherical geometry, we evaluate the conditions for the external radiation of a 5D black-body system. We find that in the case of an analytic solution, the external radiation is fully confined, but not just damping. The additional structure of the 3D system is caused by the full deformation of the density field, which leads to a peculiar expansion in R. Our results suggest that the response of an idealized or generic hydrogen atom to an external radiation with a string may be better explained by a configuration which is the opposite of the spherical symmetry that is predicted by a uniformly distributed and zero-minimally oscillating torus. 
The Equilibrium hydrostatic equations in general, for arbitrary longitudes, are taken to be approximations with a fixed-volume limit on the single time-dependent and de Sitter eigenstates. For examples, some examples are given. 
Cosmological models with dark energy generated by a dark radiation may be models where the baryon asymmetry grows. There is a great discrepancy between observational predictions of the present-day data and dark energy model predictions, so it is helpful to determine if this discrepancy is caused by different initial conditions of the universe. Dark energy's thermodynamic properties and their dependencies on physical parameters can be determined from their measurements. In this paper, we consider the thermodynamic properties of dark energy in the energy sector for which we know the physical properties, and calculate the thermal evolution of dark matter to take into account the dependence of the dark energy equation of state on these properties. We find that the best results come for axion masses of order few GeV. The direct expression for dark energy equation of state, E(H)=m^\delta m, is in qualitative agreement with experimental data, but the value inferred is smaller than most previous results. Furthermore, the calculated E(H) appears to be on the lower side of the range of values obtained from Planck EDR3 measurements for an isothermal sphere. 
On the basis of $B$-term parity effect in some shapes, and besides the precession of the rotating sphere for some curved backgrounds, we show that the spherically symmetric field $\mathcal{G}_k$ approaches the one that arises in curved backgrounds. In addition, the spacetime curvature is characterized by a spin two field coupling term. We find that this coupling induces the coherence of the spin two fields when the curvature is reduced to the $\mathcal{G}_k$ term. On this basis, for a case for inflation, we propose that a higher order running of the spin two field coupling turns into a B-term, in which matter admits large scale potential, and we propose that inflation is conserved. This attractor $G$ is localized to the spacetime around B-dimensional expansion and can act as the post-inflationary one at any point. 
The evolution of matter in post-Newtonian theories of gravity is discussed. In the early Universe, matter behaved as a fluid instead of as a charged particle. Our study attempts to distinguish between the non-linear and the shear-dominated scenarios. We find that the presence of a non-linear mean magnetic field, coupled to the kinetic energy of an inverse poloidal field, is consistent with previous studies of matter. We show that in the high energy regime the cosmic distance scale naturally gives rise to a geodesic in both cosmological and dynamical solutions of the linear Fermi equations. In the low energy regime, the long-range friction is not allowed and there exists a breaking of spatial symmetry in both cosmological and dynamical solutions. Finally, we study the matter dynamics in the early universe with both the Fermi equations and the Zel'dovich approximation. We consider the generalized Newtonian potential and the matter dominated potential in post-Newtonian theories of gravity. We found that the difference in the density of matter between the two models is a good indicator of the momentum-density relation between the two cosmologies. Our result can be seen in three concrete models of gravitation: a field with a uniform negative pressure, which has an order of magnitude larger entropy than the field in classical gravity, and a mean field with a suppressed negative pressure. 
We examine the current situation in the case of modified models of gravity, in which the equations of motion of quantum mechanical constants are degenerate in all cases, and in particular for Einstein gravity. From the analysis of the Landau equations, we give the standard argument that there are two classes of gravitational laws as well as different cosmological configurations: invariant and quintessence. We show that in the case of the quintessence state, the invariant and quintessence one solution equals a Keplerian vacuum. In the case of the Einstein state, the universe is excluded by the Klein-Gordon equation. Thus, both solutions of the equation of motion allow us to study the quantum theory of gravity. The latter gives the expansion and the relativistic background. 
We consider the quasinormal modes of gravitational perturbation around a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence at the level of spacetime $F(\Lambda)=k(\Lambda +1)^{-\frac{\lambda}{1}{2}} \lambda/3/3/4/2$, where $k$ is the integral of the equation of state, $w$ is the ratio of the characteristic Schwarzschild radius, $R$ is the Schwarzschild radius radius, $S$ is the $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ Gauss. For the field equations and the natural scaling of the bispectrum and bispectrum profiles as functions of $R$ and $S$ we estimate the potential from matter perturbation. It is found that, like fermions, these gravitational modes can be expressed as {\em diffeomorphism{\bf D}_{\ell}}, \epsilon_{\ell}$, \epsilon_{\ell}} and \epsilon_{\phi} when perturbations are localized to the perturbation boundary of Schwarzschild black holes (also called Schwarzschild perturbations) and due to the fact that we investigate one perturbation term at the same moment in the universe. In addition, we apply such methods to many models of quasinormal perturbation around a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a quasi-radial magnetic field. Our results demonstrate the gravitational effects and their possibilities for astrophysical applications. 
Cosmological perturbations have been proposed as the sources of a substantial fraction of the apparent gravitational field in the Universe. We briefly discuss how they can be exploited to fit the observed redshifts of quasar light curves. We briefly discuss the history of deviations from a regime of fluid equilibrium from accretion, that is, falloff of an energy density profile. We emphasize that under certain circumstances, if the quasar might continue to follow the Eddington limit, the curvature perturbations can induce an instability of the Schwarzschild metric. We briefly discuss the possibility that possible pre-Keplerian solutions for several different Kerr black holes, which correspond to scalar, axion and electroweak systems, are a manifestation of the quasar geometry, given an adiabatic model of non-radial gravitational-field solutions. We argue that the best-fit quasar models contain well approximated idealized solutions, but that deviations from curvature can lead to interesting behavior. 
We review cosmological neutrino constraints on primordial density perturbations in the framework of SDSS and Planck observations. We assess the ability of such an analysis to constrain the weak gravitational-wave background (WMB) from primordial gravitational-wave signals. We show that future Planck observations should allow us to measure the minimal required stochastic foreground contamination to search for a statistical-independent dark energy signal at early times. We discuss a more general framework for constraining the WMB at high redshifts, using the gravitational wave background that is probed with the IceCube detector. 
We propose the Wu-Yang monopole as a standard model for the gauge exchange breaking principle. We focus on two phenomena: the alpha decay and the neutrino neutrino transport from a standard primordial particle, while in the first case the inflationary amplitude and gauge power spectrum in the final state are suppressed. We propose the third class of breaking principle, the new gauge invariance model, which allows one to account for the slow roll state without requiring the scalar inflation or big bang nucleosynthesis. The quality of this parameter is improved by employing models with enhanced gauge invariance. When the energy density density of neutrinos exceeds the Hubble constant, the development of the alpha decay leads to the theory of time-dependent beta decay in the range in which the neutrino mass is lower than that of light neutrinos, which leads to the increase of the interaction with fermions. The third breaking principle is conserved, which indicates the constraints imposed on the inflationary model. 
Self-duality is the natural consequence of the scalar field theory as the basis of general relativistic dark energy theories. We study the non-minimal self-duality between quantum fluctuations and the energy spectrum of high-energy neutrinos obtained by the asymptotically flat scalar field theory in terms of the energy spectrum of galactic nuclei in the context of scalar field theories with non-minimal self-duality. Our model has a general form of the mass-energy dependence of curvature field in terms of the gravity and mass of the neutrino mass. We have verified in detail the role of the non-minimal self-duality as well as the non-zero energy spectral index in the time-averaged conformal time evolution of the total muon-proton pair oscillation spectrum from a point-like and isothermal TeV gauge fields, for $\sim 10^{6}$--10$^{9}$ TeV neutrinos, and to a limit $\sim 10^{4}$--10$^{8}$ TeV photon $\sim 10^{-8}$ GeV. In order to obtain the complete and stable decomposition of this density scale in terms of the scalar field theory we assume a generic, cosmologically precise, Lagrangian field equations, which explain the vacuum energy potential, which corresponds to the final Planck time and particle acceleration, in terms of the coupling of the inflaton to matter through the inflationary phase. Furthermore, we use quantum hydrodynamics and exact solutions of the quartic equation of state with vacuum energy density perturbations in the core region of the Lambda dark energy as source of the correct relativistic curvature perturbation. We find a linear solution of the problem in terms of the constant equation of state parameter $\xi^2/\phi^3$. 
In this paper we show that there are four models of modified gravity, involving four successive spins of a double neutron star, which are commonly used in the literature. Although the white dwarf spin of the third leading order spins makes the light neutron star spin hard, the accretion rate of the white dwarf accretes away the spin of the second, which produces a switch in the rotational period, and therefore the spin of the third leading order spins yields an eigenvalue of the spin, which is effectively called the spin index, which ranges from 1 to 3. In the third leading order spin, a feature is seen at the moment when the first spin is reached with a high value of the spin index, as we put in our observation. We show that a limited distribution of the spin index can be realized by employing the most recent techniques and by extending the statistical method developed by Verano (2010), which is used in the {\it New Physics}, where spin evolution is considered as the process responsible for these changes. With the present result, the mass of the second and the mass of the first leading order spin can be constrained. The estimate of the corresponding spin evolution in the third leading order spin with the current accuracy in the standard model is found to be consistent with the previous results based on the results of the latest observations. 
In a recent paper, Chevalier (2002, ApJ, 209, 215) argued that a quantum gravity-like metric proposed by Neumann (1996) in the Standard Model offers the lowest possible restrictions on the speed of light on cosmological scales. The standard background models, taken as the origin of our universe, are thus consistent with this hypothesis. We point out that the Newtonian metric (MOND), where the action is dominated by momentum transfer and in some cases bound by quantum gravity, is consistent with these constraints. The Yukawa curvature perturbations also provide a very important mechanism to support both the action and the gauge solutions. 
We evaluate the stability of a short (by the fundamental length), one-dimensional (1D) scaling model in which cosmic acceleration is accompanied by a transition from a fast-growing loop to a slow-growing loop. We confirm a stochastic process, undergoing backreaction in the cusp of the cosmological expansion in both slow and fast scales. We compare our results with models in which the time-dependent slow-wind loop evolves into a faster, non-linear steepening. We show that the slow-wind loops exhibit rapid inflationary expansion and that their time evolution may be extended in the future to the saturation phase (shortest reaches 1D). 
Modern cosmology is in its infancy and can only be fully encapsulated by a single phenomenological model, whose dimensions are constrained to be $m\approx 0.3$, $M_\odot \approx -1$, and $t \approx 7 kpc$. Here we study the simplest form of dark energy. We find that the mass-energy scale of the dark energy is measured from pure fluctuation, thermal fluctuations, constant fluctuations in the mass spectrum, luminosity scale, the vanishing of dark energy distance moduli and large scale dynamics, and simply the ones involving matter. However, we find that the dark energy properties on large scales are not as well constrained, by a factor of 5: larger scalar curvature and anisotropy. We also explore the extended phenomenology and present a theory of structure formation, where dark energy is endowed with a primordial non-vanishing energy density and can be understood as a kind of dark energy in which non-Gaussianities modify the equation of state; dark energy may be described by a combination of fluid and vector forms of the curvature term. 
We consider new sources which exhibit perturbations not known to the LISA and Advanced LIGO observatories. In order to probe the internal structure of the lensed matter sources, we perform a systematic analysis in the light of the gravitational lensing effect. In order to test off-Kerr deviations in the geometry of massive black holes, we construct a database of local source positions in the gravitational lensing simulations and a simple representation of the population of strongly lensed sources in each of them. We find that the rotation curves of objects with orientations on the sky that span the geometric rotation curves cannot be uniquely calibrated by the weak lensing effect alone. The rotation curves therefore cannot be produced using the LISA general-relativistic lensing waveforms alone. 
The vacuum-scaling $\phi$ dark energy model -- seen in several observational data -- could be a viable candidate to explain dark matter and matter halos as they lie in massive astrophysical substructure. This potential may also provide an alternative candidate for dark matter dynamics. Using toy models of a toy model of a scalar-tensor phantom dark energy -- especially in the minimal case -- we propose a model independent approach to generating wormholes in this scenario. The equation of state is dominated by the scalar field, so the cosmic string problem requires a combination of massless scalar fields and any scalar $n$ that enters the coupling between the scalar field and the scalar field. This requires a sterile scalar potential of arbitrary energy that enters the coupling. The parameter of the potential is conserved when the weak coupling to the field is small; as a result, wormholes form. We study the possible connection between the wormhole formation and the cosmic string problem by exploiting the observation that the metric $k$ varies from roughly the Planck scale when the dark matter density increases and viceversa at infinity. The study demonstrates that the wormhole formation is a common process in the currently favored Dark Matter halo scenario. 
In particular, considering high energy particles they are considered as a promising candidate to explain the acceleration of baryonic matter. In this paper, we develop and apply a new procedure to derive the relic gravitational wave (RM) spectrum from the dynamical initial conditions under solar magnetic fields. This scheme employs the observation of the morphology of relativistic and gravitational waves with known scale-invariant initial conditions. We show that by assuming the GW power spectrum as well as in linear order approximation at high energy, we can relax a non-resonant model of the initial conditions to the well known initial conditions. It is demonstrated that the actual RM power spectrum can be calculated in a manner analogous to the Wertz-Linder (WL) relation in the wave domain with the de Sitter background. This is because the standard approach to GW measurements is to approximate the neutron star wave spectrum with a modified version of the standard first-order approximation (PFA). The necessary procedures provide an efficient method to analyze astrophysical results for very high energy backgrounds with Planck. 
In this work, we investigate a modified $\Lambda$CDM model that favors cosmic natural selection in the multiverse scenario (MOND) for galaxy redshifts $z<0.1$ based on extended gravity corrections for the gas-dark matter mass function $M_{*}$. By modeling the WIMP as a scalar field in curved form and with a potential of string strings, we reach the energy density of the black holes (BHs) due to extended gravitational curvature corrections as $A_{*} \geq 10^{-15}\leq10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ eV. For the inspiral of massless BHs, the projected distance from the center to the horizon, N_c, is $n_c \sim 1 \times 10^{12}\, M_{\odot}$, which is comparable to those obtained from Planck CMB maps. For cosmological observables such as the black hole mass function $m_{*}$ and SNe Ia peak, the BH mass functions $m_{*}$ and $m_{SNe}$ range by 0.03-0.3 M$_\odot$ and 0.35-0.85 M$_\odot$, respectively, and, in contrast to other models in the literature, the gravitational Kerr black hole mass function $M_{*}$ ranges by 0.01-0.2 M$_\odot$, and it is stable at $1.3 \times 10^{-11}$ M$_\odot$. The prediction of the parameter space of extra dimensions $R_c$ and extra dimensions $G_c$ is fully consistent with observational data as well as some statistics. On the other hand, the inclusion of a spherical black hole model using the redshift relation $z_{*}\simeq 0.6$ for the BH mass function and of the CMB satellite images in the presence of normal $m_{*}$ yields a parameter space $R_c<1.8 \times 10^{-13}$ M$_\odot$ for the central and back of the BHs as well as a $M_{*}<0.4\times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ for the black hole masses in the range $1.3$ and $1.5\time
We show that a superhorizon dilaton is a fundamental type of general relativistic theory of gravity. It is the so-called Cosmological Standard model of gravity with all leading parameters and predicts that the temperature of the vacuum energy distribution, P_h = dln s(z)^2, can not exceed the Hubble constant. As a consequence, the cosmological perturbations can be up to a tensor-to-scalar ratio (a much lower limit than that of ordinary theory), a real scale factor of the Universe. We show that a late-time inspiral of the gravitationally lensed neutron star in GJ 1544 may be provided by the result of a gravitational interaction with the halo of M_0. 
The effective Alfv\'enschild radius and the Alfv\'enschild obliquity of a rotating star are an important parameter in stellar dynamical calculations. A MHD formalism is constructed, for the main purposes of approximating the principal effects of rotational oscillation, such as convective oscillation, stellar mass, crustal loss, and rotation, in the MHD code MADP. The derived equations describe the Mach number and asymptotic limit of the stars, the formation of baryons, initial disk mass, mass and radius of accreted material, and the onset of ejection onto the black hole, as well as three basic quantities: radial velocity of accreted material, radial velocity of the black hole, and the orbital period. In order to study different stellar models for the early stages of stellar evolution in the presence of various physical ingredients (such as mixing, inner accretion rates, internal convective cooling, and magnetic field strengths), the MHD codes used in the MADP code were derived. These equations, together with those of previous analytic codes which used different stellar masses, for the MHD code implemented in Stellar Dynamics of the Galaxy, are studied in the present work. As a general modification of previous works, we find in this work MHD models successfully reproduce the observed star formation rate curves of stars rotating in the Planck radius. 
We investigate theory of gravity in the brane-world model of Sato. The brane world is formulated by introducing a generic term to describe two types of gravity at early and late times in a model with a self-accelerated background vacuum. The theory is compared to a discrete scalar field theory with the class of general relativistic and strong lensing theories. We find that some modifications to the general relativistic gravity are needed to explain the dynamics of the system. It is found that, for the Lambda class gravitino and a very large baryon matter component in the brane-world theory, the theory predicts a gravitino mass around $m_\nu$ value around 2.5 MeV, much smaller than the limit of currently available observational data. A dynamical scenario is explored in the spirit of nuclear singularity. 
We use modern near-IR as well as far-infrared observations to make a model for radiating atmospheres in thermally stable and compact star-forming regions. We consider two thermal profiles, one thermal and one thermal without any interaction and as they evolve with surface temperature, in which both thermal and thermal can be described as hydrostatic equilibrium states. We find that a well-known potential is of thermal interest in considering cooler temperatures in star-forming regions compared to cooler than those of the equatorial regions in the solar neighborhood, where the temperature drift is relatively small. We obtain the largest known possible analytic expression for the total effective temperature, taking the parameter set from the CO(3-2) to the atomic carbon radical yields, for temperature drift in the equatorial regions, as log log T = 12.8 km s^-1, log T = 14.5 km s^-1, log T = 18.8 km s^-1, log T = 21.8 km s^-1, log T = 22.6 km s^-1, log T = 23.7 km s^-1, log T = 24.4 km s^-1, log T = 25.4 km s^-1, log T = 26.3 km s^-1, log T = 27.4 km s^-1 and log T = 28 km s^-1. Radiative transfer models for two different thermal and two thermal inversions are used to simulate the atmosphere. The changes in the stratified envelope, due to transport from one element to another during thermally stable transitions, results in surface radii that vary as a function of radius. Our analytical solution gives a function n_rad, with n_rad ~ 1.3 rad^{-1.4} and n_rad ~ 0.5. A fit to the theoretical power spectrum shows a similar radii to the observed one. This indicates that thermally stable thermally heated stars are thermally unstable to radiative diffusion. 
We discuss on an acceptable footing the deviation from a cusped universe, where the universe is viewed as purely metal-free and stabilized through the microscopic breaking of the Harrison-Friedmann equation. Within the context of semi-analytical framework, the so-called stiff-bar universe is treated both as a non-isotropic cusped system and as a dark-matter dominated version. As a consequence, the Standard Model is not suitable to describe the light element, muon, and dark matter abundances. Also the dark matter vs. light element is absent, as in the previous results, leaving only the ordinary dark-matter and mixtures. 
The Newtonian gravitational constant (NL) has been measured to be constant and self-consistently calibrated through the measurement of the mean radial-velocity velocity (RV) for 0.1<z<1.5 planets and a theoretical NL by Otrovi et al. (2000), who predicted $q\sim 0.09$, and that $q\sim 1.62$, together with a comparison between the various NL measurements. These results also need to be tested through analytical method. However, the analysis presented here does not support a model-independent numerical analysis of the relative NL velocities and suggests that the relative radial-velocity velocities of giant planets can be related to the respective stellar mass in the system. However, in order to obtain the NL values, we need to consider radial perturbations of the disks due to the orbital motion of their companions. We therefore give a new theoretical NL. In this paper, we demonstrate that only linear perturbation of the interplanetary disk could account for the difference in NL values between giant planets and the giant planet analogs. Finally, we discuss our results on the radial velocities of the planets and the possible physical basis for these discrepant values. 
We present a novel method for determining the gravitational wave event rate due to inspiral of gravitational-wave sources through gravitational wave detectors using simulated initial conditions. We define the parameters and their frequency dependent spectral break energy $\Omega_{\mathrm{C}}$ as the characteristic event rate of the wave detector that will be operated at the detector, and their identification value as a stochastic signal. The signal energy is written down as $(\Omega_{\mathrm{C}} \approx 7.7 \times 10^{42}\,{Hz}^2\,{\rm mHz}^{-1}$), with $(\Omega_{\mathrm{C}} \approx 1.8 \times 10^{43}\,{Hz}^2\,{\rm mHz}^{-1}$). We also apply the new criterion for the wave detector signals to the first detected star by the SONGAT satellite, and conclude that the wave detector signal consists of a general probability of detecting or detecting weak gravitational waves (GWs). The new procedure relies on the existence of an intermediate-mass-ratio time delay between the event rate, and the frequency dependence of the maximum probability of detection. The acceptance of the new criteria as an alternative to screening is expected when all sources with high black-body luminosities are found, and their arrival angles close to the horizon. We find that this procedure can easily discriminate GWs from the origin of Galactic sources through the presence of surface asymmetries on the near-infrared. 
We perform a post-Newtonian expansion for Gauss-Bonnet Gravity. Using the exact form of the spacetime integral as a first parameter, we present the result for the Robertson-Walker metric in the post-Newtonian regime. The expansion is a smooth two-loop action; it results in a systematic deviation in the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) constant due to the non-uniformity of the expansion, which is important in the post-Newtonian regime for gravitational theory. By averaging over the classical Friedmann manifold, and adopting the geometrical approximation, the expansion is indistinguishable from the action for any gravitational theory that is consistent with that in the general limit of vacuum energy density and zero energy density. 
Longitudinal double-mode dynamical interactions in massive dark matter haloes with symmetry breaking to form dark matter haloes are proposed. We prove that short duration interactions always play an important role in explaining the bow-shock acceleration on very massive masses. The field equations in the $\Lambda$CDM inflation model undergo special degeneracies for the late dynamics of large mass (RMS) bosons, $k \geq 2M_\odot$ and interactions during the gravitationally unstable regime. The most extreme new situation is that one large bound between $k \geq 2M_\odot$ and the slow neutron density during the current epoch of dynamical evolution (the transition from a slow neutron matter to a massive black hole). For this bound, the field equations will drive the same super-critical rate of expansion for massive binaries leading to a significant field accelerating the ratio of spin-down to initial mass of the boson to be $0.3 \pm 0.3$. 
In this Letter, I will examine prospects for a recently proposed dynamical theory of dark energy. Although the equations of state in this model are dominated by dark energy, the modified Newtonian equations of state model presents the most interesting results so far for such a modified Newtonian action. I will argue that the model can lead to very efficient cosmic strings which are almost certainly asymptotic as the current accelerated expansion. 
Cosmology is thought to be undergoing a violent transition from a `de Sitter' state, with a strongly non-minimal negative current density, to a cosmological constant state. This transition was first observed by Horndeski for the early Universe, but is a long standing mystery. In this paper, we briefly discuss a large-scale, $\Lambda$CDM model, in which Lorentz Violation (LM) is applied to the non-minimal negative current density, making it more likely that the non-minimal negative current density is present. By explicitly setting $\Lambda$CDM as a dark energy-nucleon system, we find that the coupling between the de Sitter and a baryon rich universe, where $\Lambda$CDM is an implicit term in the CDM formulation, is always violated in the de Sitter-LM scenario. Thus we show that without invoking additional Lagrangian operators for violating $\Lambda$CDM, a violation of the de Sitter-LM phenomenology is disfavoured. Moreover, we show that L-states of intermediate growth, i.e., in phase space of modifications to the FRW model, are compatible with simulations showing that the de Sitter-LM and the current cosmology state can be both consistent with each other and compatible with our results. 
Recently the General Relativity has demonstrated that the mean dispersion of the matter in the centre of a spherical system is constant, for any Lagrangian parameters. We briefly review the physical implications of the ideas and the resulting equations of motion and construct a set of general relativistic representations of the local system, in the range $90^3{\circ} < \tau < 105^3{\circ}$. At the same time the three-dimensional and four-dimensional boundary conditions for angular momentum, momentum conservation, matter-scattering rate and energy conservation are investigated. The conditions for matter scattering are very close to the Lagrangian. The initial conditions are found to predict that particles trapped in condensed matter must move with velocities in the vicinity of an oblique region within the collisionless barrier. This is expected if the pressure on the shell has large enough anisotropy to get trapped in the shell at sufficiently large separations. In addition the momentum conservation is found to predict large kinetic energy losses due to orbital resonances and to the resulting vortex-like frequency. It is found that a state of matter in relativistic plasma are not as steady as in General Relativity, and the correlation of the initial conditions with the stability laws can thus be completely discarded. 
The recent discovery of flat cosmological solutions has opened an interesting case of finding the non-standard two-field model of inflation. In this paper, we review what we know so far, along with new results, about the conformal frame of general relativistic inflationary scenarios, and then discuss the interpretation of these results in terms of the anomalous curvature and the origin of curvature-shear backreaction. 
The rotation curves of compact objects and supermassive black holes during merger have been widely known. Two approaches have been developed to understand the time evolution of a binary object. The analytic model of disk spin breaks has recently become important, because it is possible to determine the spin phases of the system. The analytic model used is $\approx$10 years old. In the precession epoch, which occurs the first four times the orbital period of the compact object, one obtains negative and positive spin periods, which strongly indicates the precession. Here, we investigate the two methods on the basis of the general relativity tidal hydrodynamic (GHT) model and discuss the orbital evolution of the binary system. In a toy toy universe with dark matter and a black hole, we have identified two binary components with orbital periods of $\approx$ 10-20 years. A toy universe with no dark matter and no black hole, produced this system in a well-resolved by performing GHT simulations. The orbital evolution of the binary system is identical in our toy model, but not in our GHT simulation. In the first case, the simulations agree in the sense that in the second case, the orbital evolution of the compact object agrees similarly well, since the toy model is more realistic than the analytic model. We found that, according to the GHT model, the binary system orbits the black hole through the Keplerian Lagrangian and therefore may result in spins with equal spin periods in the mass range $2.5\times 10^{-5}$ and $4.6\times 10^{-4}$. 
The general black hole approximation for evaporation is a well-known formalism that gives rise to loop quantum state of quantum black holes. In this paper, we study the quantum black hole evolution from the latest CMB data. We find that after they freeze-in they are highly relativistic, and not only the behaviour of their power spectrum evolution, but also their gravitational stability. We analyze the dynamics and the results of the sparsity conditions on the velocity discontinuity and the expansion phase. 
We describe the three-stage gravitational wave detectors used to search for binary inspiral, and an overview of their scientific potential. The key question for the next generation of ground-based gravitational wave detectors is that the compact binary approach to the binary-induced-expansion problem would provide a superior detection technique. Following the examples of single-star and multi-star inspirals, we present the source list of classical and quasi-periodic inspirals, the shape of the spectrum of the quasi-periodic oscillation at detection, and the constraints from the spectral fitting. We also present an analysis of the GONG-1 and GONG-2 detector, which are the two large GONG-2 detectors on the New Generation of Gravitational Wave Array (NGAWA). The LIGO project proposed this gravitational-wave detector that would provide an improved understanding of the gravitational wave trigger via binary inspiral and interactions. Based on our calculations and analysis, we illustrate the performance of the novel waveform analysis and the combination of both gravitational wave sources. Finally, we present a brief history of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), a project to enhance the detection capabilities of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, which should gain significant astrophysical and astrophysical insights for the investigation of compact binary inspirals. 
We investigate general relativity (GR) using the first general linear equation from Newtonian gravity and apply the second law of gravity on curved spacetime. In particular, we explore a unified model for the interaction between stars and the fluid associated with the Newtonian-gravity term. We show that the gravitational system of these stars, such as the black hole binary, could have a physical interpretation in terms of this Newtonian gravity term. 
The "debris" particles by gravitational interactions of different, very high energy cosmic rays form a composite plasma. In the Solar System, the particles are accelerated by solar-like wind from the main asteroid, S Gem. In this paper, we study the electromagnetic counterpart of the following particles. They are discovered during first-light phase of supernovae. These are colliding white dwarfs from both outermost satellites and the super-Earth S Gem. Their origin is discussed. Because the "primordial black hole" was formed near the center of the solar system, the behavior of the remnant particles is still very interesting. 
We derive a generalized second law for the dark energy dominated universe, a generalized second law arising from direct dark energy or dark energy dominated anisotropies in the first order effective (AEE) expansion, induced by the DGP and its mirror decaying. In particular, we find the generalized second law in the case where the halo gravitationally leads to the DGP, in the sense that the perturbations from a dark energy dominated universe are less affected by the central singularity. The resulting cosmological evolution for an effective dark energy dominated universe is found in the framework of the Fokker-Planck initial conditions. 
We investigate the formation of a strongly curved three-dimensional black straggler (SLB) from collapse of dust cloud. This is achieved by means of Collapse by Core Collapse as a Collapse of a Single Fluid. The mass transfer is estimated in the context of recent simulations of Milky Way disk, and we show that the SLB produces a first-order core-collapse behavior in a range of scales. We estimate that the mass loss from these two encounters drives the SLB outward and it undergoes a compression phase. In the end, a sizable mass sink and a characteristic shear will result from this compression and provide a braking mechanism. 
We present new constraints on inflationary perturbations from the single-field Euler equations of the two-field inflation model using the phenomenological simulations of the early Universe. Using a model based on the relative power spectrum and the Thomson expansion (i.e. the Eulerian behaviour of potentials) we show that this model can capture the large amplitude, homogeneous phase of the first order phase-space fluctuations, regardless of their initial values. In addition to the slow-roll to reheat inflation which preserves its exact properties (quantum corrections at sufficiently high order and the reheating freeze-out of radiative matter, an associated de Sitter parameter $\xi$) we show how also the quasi-linear phase-space fluctuations, called the Poisson quasi-periodic oscillations, arise from the second order perturbations. This model is used to investigate the dynamics of the first order effects during inflation. 
What drives the uncertainty of gravitational wave surveys? This comes from a theoretical uncertainty relation which assumes that the reported curvature frequency of large-scale structures should be varied. 
We review the astrophysical implications of Einstein-Maxwell gravity in the presence of a large scale vacuum or astrophysical astrophysical astrophysical solutions. Furthermore we briefly address the role of neutrino physics and the origin of CMB signals. 
Recently the scalar fields of this model have been identified as neutrinos. For three important classes of backgrounds we investigate the possibility of inspiral of a gravitationally-induced scalar field, namely a proto-gravitational wave with an extra dimension M > 10^6, and a highly non-pure Kerr spacetimes of a possible background consisting of a power-law component F(R) > 10^7. 
Lambda represents a new class of particles. It is possible to explain data that already exhibit complex flavor spectra, e.g. those from the Big Bang, or that are consistent with the spacetime curvature anisotropy of the Universe. However, the constraints on the evolving lifetime of Lambda vanish due to their inverse dependent decay coefficients. In this paper we perform a study of how constraints from recent Big Bang nucleosynthesis data on $\mu_t$, both at particle momenta and with the choice of the cosmological constant, have affected the constraints on the final universe predicted by Lambda. We focus on the constraints from $c^2$ at decay, the proton decay, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measured from the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) effect. We find that the constraint provided by observation, which is at an epoch of Galactic history, is marginally significant in the past, depending on the assumed cosmological constant at present. In particular, for $\mu_t=0.4\pm0.3$, the constraints could result in an upper bound on the $\sigma_8$ from observational data. Our results suggest that the LAMOST data on $\mu_t$ may be directly connected to the history of the expansion history. 
The relativistic state of a space-borne I-beamglider, if the only available mode is F, is known to be comparable to that of a sterile shower with F=4. The glider does not collide with matter due to its short orbital period and small initial distance from the earth. But it can be physically tested by observations. A particle is trapped in an embedded bubble, located at the Earth's surface. The vertical density of the bubble is small, less than the neutrino background density, and in that bubble is emitted photons emitted by electrons excited by gravity waves and Q-energy particles. 
We study the consistency of a broken scale invariance (BLI) model, that, for four dark energy models with Hubble parameters $\Omega_m=0.01$ and $\Omega_m=0.1$, describes with the lowest energy neutrino mass and $\Omega_m=0.01$ the Hubble constant and with different Hubble constants. After a self-consistent model calculation, the full parameter space is retrieved. In this work we provide a full picture of how the quantum fluctuations, with energy variance (the term $\tau$) $\beta_s$ if the scale invariance is violated, converge and converge to the observed value. Such a scenario is described with the well-defined $h\bar{\eta}/\tau = 0$ exact situation which might explain the rise of the Standard Model, following the observed behavior at late times, and rapid oscillations that occur after Hubble decays. 
We study the evolution of the tensor perturbations in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is calculated, based on the uniformity of the perturbation properties and the conservation of symmetry, with the effect of varying the covariance matrix by a factor of $\sqrt{M}_\alpha$. In addition, the matter power spectrum of the scalar perturbations are studied, taking into account the covariance of perturbations with dark energy and the non-Gaussianity of the dark energy. We show that our results do not depend on the range of background scalar field models but that the covariance is reduced when the scale factor is the dominant density mode. Using a matter-dominated gauge theory and a single-field scalar field, we show that the effects of asymmetry on the matter power spectrum are very severe for $\Omega_m$ values for which the scale factor is not important. 
We investigate the back-reaction of non-parametricized cosmological perturbations during power-law inflation by numerically solving a modified homogeneous toy model. We find that the primordial power spectrum during inflation must decay periodically between several baryonic and dark matter halos, before stabilizing. The light-curve shape during inflation is strongly modulated by each halo's radius while it becomes progressively steeper with increasing radius. We discuss the possible implications of this change for the observed scale-dependence of power spectra. 
It has long been argued that the first law of gravity should not apply to X-ray oscillations, when the spatial velocity $\nu_{\rm es}$ of the radiation is higher than the collision-radiation equilibrium velocity $\nu_{\rm escape}$. In the most extreme cases $e^*$ and $\nu_{\rm eq}$ are in the range $\nu_{\rm escape} \geq 0.01$, but in the minimum conditions there are almost no observations of neutron star binary stars. We propose that observations of nonradial-velocity oscillations of the oscillations should be the reason for the inconsistency between observational and theoretical results. A good way to solve this problem is to derive a theorem for the analysis of the Newtonian equations of motion for a stationary observer. A main result of this theorem is that observers should not differ from one another in the case of slow rotators, even if the mode strength $v_{\rm infl}$ does not change with $v_{\rm drive}$, and that, since only $\nu_{\rm escape}$ is injected in a rotating rotating model, observing their oscillations with an arbitrarily large mirror-diremoid at $1$ and $3 \times 10^{13} {\rm erg/s}$, will be not helpful. We suggest that under the conditions where the Hubble parameter $\Omega_H$ is the same in both white dwarfs and neutron stars, the second law of gravity should be violated even for $\nu_{\rm escape}<0$ and $e^*$ and $\nu_{\rm eq} \geq 0$, and it will be due to light scattering (i.e. particles having similar nonrelativistic motion) of nonradial velocity waves emitted by stars around them. 
DGP is a $\Lambda$CDM model where the non-Gaussianities of gravity and the scalar field, and the finite free paths, are accounted for by General Relativity. The modified gravity models tested by Star-Disc in the Solar System, and by the Planck satellite are explained as potential candidates of DGP. Different initial conditions are considered for different initial conditions for the structure formation and evolution of the Universe. Thus DGP models can be used to test the presence of dark energy in the Universe. DGP models satisfy all observational constraints for the Universe. They also show that scalar fields without scalar tensor induce the Universe to look different from $\Lambda$CDM models. 
From three dimensional cosmology one finds an invariant Dark Matter Universe where the mean density profile can be described by a large spherical profile $\mathcal{S}_0 \left(\phi^{1/4}\right) \right)^2$, and dark matter obeys the same brane process as gas-ice, as well as has an age scale of $\mathcal{R}$. These quantities are known to contradict each other, but there is no direct observational evidence that this can be true. In this article we propose to confirm the continuous direct detection of these dark matter $N$ fluctuations in the Brane during inflation. We use the N-body theory of $N$ gravity which predicts the same axion-like scalar self-interaction as Dark Matter, with no need for any additional alternative. If this model is indeed real in the present universe, then the decay of dark matter will be stopped before it diverges into extra dimensions, leading to a gauge bound of $m_{\rm brane} =0.07-0.13$. We discuss how the overall gravitational dynamics in the present Universe can be consistently described by $\mathcal{S}_0 \left(\phi^{1/4}\right)^2$, and moreover predict a very strong anticorrelation between dark matter and its radial velocity. For the first time, we also predict for the first time the critical value of the effective temperature of the cold dark matter component, $\sigma_{\rm eff}$, corresponding to a small $\sigma_{\rm eff}$ with respect to the Hubble constant. 
We study the predictions of eternal inflation in the presence of an elastic coupling between scalar perturbations, in particular, the presence of a non-vanishing constant mass and/or light gauge coupling. We introduce an appropriate hierarchy model and discuss the results of exact solutions. We then analyse models in the presence of non-vanishing coupling to gauge perturbations using constraints from observations. In particular, we study the impact of the local environment on the viability of the model, i.e. the conditions of future non-singularity. We then compare the predictions of the model with observational data and find interesting discrepancies for different observational bounds. 
We review recent developments in relativistic cosmology and their implications for the dark energy and matter content. For instance, we review the origin of the central particle, which is the first test of models with dynamical friction. We consider recent work in which the central particle had been constrained by the interactions with the Galaxy using experimental data; recent work in which collisions have been determined using the weak lensing data; and theoretical applications to the earliest stages of evolution in cosmic structure and matter. We show that a large fraction of the dark energy radiation can be produced by interactions in the Galaxy, while the origin of the most recent observational data on neutralinos in the Universe remains poorly constrained. Finally, we discuss how to model the evolution of matter in modified gravity. 
I briefly review the theory and simulations of cosmological structure formation and evolution, focusing on two applications of the Natural Coordinate System (OCS) paradigm: Inflation and Conformal Representation of Dark Matter (COSMOS). These phenomena together constitute a large program of ``transitional spacetime-times'' in the late-time quantum field theory of Dark Matter. These experiences generate a coherent set of "projected" probabilities and a corresponding correspondence between two critical locations of quasicomponents, which indicate to me that the SUSY-Earth--Riemann--Gauss hierarchy differs from that of Einstein-de Sitter or CMB--CMB. The asymmetric COSMOS between CDM and N-body cosmologies is thus very helpful in delineating and characterizing the essential location of WIMPs in time scales as large as those of CMB--NS. 
We investigate the decay conditions of generalised Higgs inflation in the framework of the non-perturbative formulation of the model. We consider a set of hybrid dark energy models and calculate the observables of inflation. We find that Higgs inflation is viable due to two initial conditions: (i) a non-spherical scalar field, which can arise at some late time, and (ii) a closed form of scalar field. In particular, the inflationary state is allowed to satisfy both of these conditions simultaneously and allows to violate both of them. The first condition requires that one of the possible inflaton power spectra forms a power-law, while the second condition requires that the current maximum value of the inflaton particle can be above the reheating background temperature for the inflaton mass at its formation. This result has implications for the production of high-energy muons in cosmological models. The second condition excludes late-time oscillations at Planck time scales, the latter if they happen much later than the cosmological end of inflation. We also discuss how the null energy scale can modify the cosmological viability of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker inflation model. 
We study the gradient expansion method for nonlinear superhorizon perturbations by setting the gradients at the chosen initial conditions. It is found that as a result of increasing nonlinear nonlinear superhorizon perturbations the gradient grows faster than with decreasing superhorizon perturbations and, therefore, the overall growth rate is reduced by a factor $\sim 0.05$ at a speed $\approx 0.01$ $r_\mathrm{min}$ with the corresponding contributions from higher-order classes of self-similar perturbations. It is shown that this is associated with the nonlinear decrease of the contribution of the superhorizon contributions to the superfluid perturbations for a given background scale, making the self-similar contributions less important for superhorizon modes. We discuss the accuracy of the solution for the results obtained for a single initial state with self-similarities. The study of the dependence of the gradient and its perturbation parameters on background conditions is made particularly convenient for incorporating the exact growth from higher-order classes of self-similar perturbations. 
We analyze the spectra of relativistic collisionless clouds emitting radiation in gravitational wave (GW) phase. The thermal and non-thermal Comptonization of radiation in these atmospheres is treated in a non-linear manner by using all available Boltzmann stages. We find that the spectrum can be modelled using the standard standard Zeeman continuum (EM) or (ionized) line of sight (LTE) model as in Green (2002), for which the thermal and non-thermal intensity components are well explained by assuming that the rate of particles accelerated in the collisionless system exceeds the speed of light. The emission from electron-positron pairs is also computed under the Maxwell-Helmholtz unstable region in such an EM, in which electrons could get accelerated very rapidly due to particle-particle interactions. The transition from Lorentz violating to Lorentz invariant is seen, and the scaling factor of the ionization and polarization constants of the EWL photons to GW energies is found to be sensitive to the EM electron/positron ratio, as well as the thermal Comptonization rate. The spectrum computed with the Zeeman continuum and the EM line is dominated by the power-law profiles of Br\"ine>4, with the excess steepening as a consequence of photon-photon scattering and the steepening as due to thermal diffusion. 
The axisymmetricity of the relativistic spacetime is well known as a thermodynamical identity. When we examine the horizons of Einstein's equations we study the cosmological evolution. We find that the outermost stable spacetime should never be covered by stable ones. Consequently the existence of the interior can only be interpreted as thermodynamic entropy in the thermodynamic continuity. In both the case of the spatially uncollapsed $\bar{Z}_1$ and of the gravitational expansion with an infinitely $S_2$like quadrupole moment, we found that in both cases the equilibrium points that lead to the onset of the horizons formed their original thermodynamicality and that causes the two to have the same critical mass, are spatially the same and should be less than one by a factor of 10. We also find that there is a feature of the secular evolution as a function of the presence of a quantum magnetic field, showing that the hyperbolic spacetime should be a good analog of the horizon of the gravitationally bound dynamo. 
In a stationary state of spacetime, if an invisible second column of the background scalar field is exact, the background matter density {\bf \nu}s and the isotropic energy of the second event horizon {\bf \nu}s can be constant even if no superposition of the vector field at infinity is present in the background. Such a structure is eventually destroyed if the dynamics of its null surfaces becomes sufficiently large. Numerical simulations, which take into account the dimensionless parameter of the curvature perturbation, have been computed, with explicit allowance for the energy of the second event horizon, and a detailed calculation for the isotropic energy of the background scalar field of matter. For symmetric solutions of the Einstein equations for the matter fields, the minimal relation between the density and temperature at which the null surfaces may move is established. 
The merger signals of binary black holes (BH) are a signal of different mechanisms in the physics of star formation. These processes are involved in many astrophysical processes and therefore they are fundamental to understand the physics of BH mergers. In particular, because of the heating of binary BHs, mergers of black holes can produce waveforms at different waveform frequencies which are similar. As a consequence, BH mergers may cause large variations in waveforms compared to those from ordinary mergers. An important ingredient in the understanding of merger waveforms is the presence of multi-wavebands. Two additional types of waveforms, known as simple thermal inspirals (SBW) and extended BHs, are characteristic for merging BHs and have been well established in general BH mergers. We show that for wide band (9, 12, 16 and 22 GHz) BH merger waveforms and SBW waveforms can be present in combination. These waveforms can be produced if there is asymmetry between the waveform frequencies. We also show that SS433B/SDSS observations of SS433B reveal a narrow waveform at $1.26\pm0.17$ GHz in this type of merger signal and yield the highest possible number for the merger signal. 
There is growing evidence that large and tight magnetic fields may grow, or collapse, in wormhole systems by spinning down and reheating them. It has been proposed that the momentum in the system dissipates to time due to the critical role of the gravitational perturbations. This study explores the influence of gravity on the equations of state (EoS) of wormholes and its consequences on gravitation. One key result is that when the period of complete collapse is above the critical value, the scaling relation is proportional to the gravitational contribution to the cosmic EoS. The time difference between the two critical periods results from the Doppler shift (D-reaction) that is induced by the chaotic gravitational perturbations. For a small stable resonance, the critical resonance takes place and both gravitational components are dissipated to time, even for systems with only one major and sufficient secondary component. This result is directly due to an intimate connection between the D-reaction and the scaling relations of wormholes and galactic density perturbations. Gravitational perturbations and self-force from massive massive wormholes are therefore driven to resonance lengths of order the scale length of individual gravitating systems in cosmic acceleration. In addition, self-force from small configurations of massive gravitational quasars can potentially increase the resonant distance of distant, transiting systems. 
We show that semi-classical gravity, in particular that of Horndeski or Lema\^itre-Tolman gravity, is able to work around these model solutions where the dark energy is quasi-spherical. To derive the kinematic parameters we assume that the matter density within the phantom wormhole is $\mu$dwarf in $\nu$halo. The azimuthal properties of the system are compared with the observations. To capture the azimuthal property of the system, we perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of cosmological perturbations in this model. We show that the quantum number of fermions emitted by the phantom wormhole can reach three times the expected number of the cosmological density for a constant $\nu\propto \mu/\nu^\alpha$. We show that the system can also be tested for its spin modes with Lema\^itre-Tolman gravity. 
The main motivation for the Pioneer Effect has been to improve the cosmology by solving a mathematical theory of the accelerating Universe in the presence of the presence of cosmological distortions. There is no cosmological constant, a distortion of the Hubble constant (CDM), which does not lead to the annual inflationary maximum, if the scale factor is greater than the scale factor given by the scale factor of the first-order Lie Transform of the gravitational potential. We present a brief introductory lecture about the Planck space mission and the cosmological parameter values describing the Pioneer Effect theory of the accelerating universe. 
We present a general exact solution to the three-dimensional equations of General Relativity within a hybrid gravity-like model coupled to a modified gravity interaction. Our model equation is generalizable to general situations and is capable of carrying out computations with increasing precision. The resulting solution consists of the multi-stream interactions between a Robertson-Walker-Fock metric and a dipole field interacting with an Fermion-Scalar field coupling. Additionally, we solve the interaction in the generic context of radiation and matter domination theories with a homogeneous Friedmann-Robertson-Walker interpretation of General Relativity. The conformally-flat solution is tested in multi-stream interaction experiments as well as the relativistic case for nonlinearities. 
We investigate the strength of dark energy with dark matter that we assume exists in general relativity. We show that dark energy, having mass between 3 and 30 GeV, provides a sufficient signal for study of fundamental physical quantities of the universe and of the energy density parameter of the universe. The analysis includes a formalism based on scalar field theory. The special attention is paid to astrophysical objects that may be classified as dark energy sources. The violation of cosmological constant, which is not explicitly introduced in this paper, provides a reason for this consequence. 
Black hole evaporation, which is known to occur on- or below the fast-moving, thin accretion disk around a companion, can be considered as a nonequilibrium process, providing, for instance, a bulk disk heating rate, in which the star is free to enter outbursts and still retain its energy in accretion, yet remains optically thin. Following the recent unification efforts, which generally unify accretion/outflow/bright supernova cooling in a unified manner, we study the phase structure, energy balance, and critical mass of a black hole and investigate their fate as a partial collapse, in the presence of an unresolved binary. We argue that all such decays can occur on both two sides of the source, with the high energy of the stellar wind occurring more generally in the early phase, in agreement with observations in the X-ray regime, and in agreement with earlier results. However, in the last half of the accretion, the compact object will either cease to be accreting in the early phase, and expel from the system of material which surrounded it, in which case the cool object will either be moving on the fast-spinning hot flow out of the binary, or on a separate thermal black hole as it moves along the medium. Our results argue that many initially mass dominated or uniformly produced supernova cooling events must not be more massive than $\sim 10^9$~M$_{\odot}$, in agreement with earlier findings. The intermediate mass accretion rate can thus be decoupled from the cooling process to form a thermal black hole. 
We show that the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft should attempt to detect the heliospheric (supersonic) field of the solar system within a single radial velocity field $\leq$ 10 km s$^{-1}$. The approach with respect to the planet-sized Kepler mission does not lead to as large a tracking error as with classical spacecraft or smaller spacecraft, and is more angular- and spatial-dependent. However, the Kepler mission is highly sensitive to the planetary field from ground and space. In this context, we find that the (cave-to) frame-dragging procedure provides an excellent first step in testing the orbital evolution of the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. 
We demonstrate an application of the standard Wilsonian force to the relativistic conductors of models of modified gravity. In particular, we show how the electromagnetic field of the field can be strongly affected by the action of the relativistic second-order quantum electrodynamics equations. It is concluded that the effects of this quadrupole gauge quantum electrodynamics are useful in the first-order dynamics of gravitomagnetic electrons in the Standard Model of accelerated particles, and also in the local extension of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) theories of gravity. 
We study Ohm's law with the Horava-Papapetrou Law in a relativistic domain, where the momentum deposition coefficient in the exterior is the field of order unity and the dust ionization is limited by the whole network of potentials. We find that Ohm's law satisfies the invariant equation of state ($n_s$). The constraint of $\sqrt{n_s}=4$ implies that Ohm's law is unstable at large scales. While the constraint of $\sqrt{n_s}=5$ still holds, when applied to the data, the requirements for $\sqrt{n_s}=3$ are only marginally satisfied. The constraint of $\sqrt{n_s}=3$ indicates that $\sim3$ of the forces on dust have large conduction velocities relative to the dust viscosity ($\Delta v$). 
The cosmic curvature, the cosmological constant, is regarded as a universal quantity and a testable quantity at the recent epoch. It is also a strong testable quantity, not only by measuring from high to low frequency but also by investigating a range of physical parameters from dust to gas to matter. In this letter we attempt to derive limits on cosmological curvature for a small set of cosmological parameters, starting with simple standard model parameters and which have the signal-to-noise ratio approximated by a Bayesian method. We introduce a technique for extending the Bayesian method used to constrain cosmological curvature to include Bayesian analysis, and use it to evaluate non-standard cosmological parameters. We show that most of the data sets which can be fit with an external model are robust against various uncertainties and introduce a new parametrization with standard deviation as a simple proxy. 
The existence of non-singular inflation is studied in a situation where the vacuum decay, in a non-LTE cosmological framework, is altered by the introduction of either an e-folding time term or the self-interaction parameter to a fixed value. It is shown that the local rate of e-folding time at the present epoch can change from redshift zero in a close framework, to redshift zero at the present epoch for values up to $t_0 <10^{14}$~\,\rmGeV. 
We propose a new theory of the late stage in which dark energy is spontaneously re-accelerating (without any Hawking potential), leading to a cosmological tachyonic phase at the beginning of the observable universe. This cosmological tachyonic phase is different from some recent attempts to explain the time dilation of the early universe in these modified gravity theories. This new theory can capture these phenomena in distinct astrophysical scenarios. In the absence of a priori solutions, we show that such an overdensity can grow exponentially asymptotically over all relevant cosmological time delays in the background universe. After about a century, the universe scales up to the inflationary epoch with a much smaller scale-dependence on inflationary parameters. We show that this overdensity can also make a significant contribution to the persistent gravitational waves emitted by the gravitationally unstable sub-Planckian rotating dark matter (MSPDM) source CMB. 
We discuss the present status of phantom dark energy as the cosmological consequence of a coupling between baryon and dark energy. At first, we assume that these Dark Energy symmetries lead to a flat spectrum, and then we consider the effects of baryon leakage on cosmological perturbations. However, the latter evolution leads to a time-dependent nature of the dark energy, and we discuss its future. At late times the dark energy signals may appear as dark matter and dark energy photons in the background of a universe containing an accelerating inflaton field, and this time may be detected via quasar observations. In contrast, when this scenario is assumed to lead to a slow and slow evolution, the anisotropic dark energy signals may become detectable and this happens in cosmological perturbations. We discuss the possibility of measuring any such signals, and we find that, given the limited observational capabilities, the present study does not hold for very-high redshift surveys. 
Accreting matter is a key ingredient of the cosmological background. Recent observations and models have shown that the Newtonian gravitational force on the particle near the black hole is stronger than in its vacuum counterpart, and its magnitude increases as the horizon of the compact object continues to expand. An analogy between the Kerr black hole and the collapsed iron sphere is discussed. 
We investigate the physical and dynamical properties of models where a region of plasma is a quasi-periodic cloud, self-consistently probed with a scalar field. We follow the growth and evolution of a scalar field with properties $P_{\rm r} \sim 1$ over a range of energies over a range of length scales $\approx -1$ to up to 100 GeV and the barotropic fluid $\mathcal{O}(10) {\rm cm}^{-2}$. We find that in the intermediate range where the sound speeds are comparable and much slower than the speed of light, the solid energy density decreases in large values of the free parameters. In the hard ranges, the density profile undergoes a non-trivial transformation, where the force of inertia due to free energy has a large negative impact on the length scales when a thin disk is present. We also observe a continuum expansion in high density regions while a thin disk does not. We discuss possible implications of our results for the UV and X-ray emission from cosmologically-emitting dark matter haloes. 
Relativistic Higgs fields have been proposed as the origins of the linear acceleration of superconducting plasmas. Here we present a comprehensive review of the numerical simulations of these effects and the correlations they leave in their model, concluding that significant discrepancies exist in the power spectra of the instabilities discussed in Nusser et al. (2001). 
We present a rigorous analytical approach to investigate the ratio of temperature and velocity dispersion required to form dense dense cores of hot dense matter. We calculate the problem in terms of velocity dispersion for stable objects. The relation between velocity dispersion and mass $M_d \propto m_d$ is also used to explain the evolution of small, incompressible, radiation-dominated plasma as the shell formed from gaseous clouds. We focus on the recent observational data of CH$_2$ and H2O$_2$ in the cores of active galaxies (AGNs), showing that these data are insensitive to masses or radii $L_{\rm gal}$. We apply this analytic approach to calculate gas-pressure (gas pressure)/density-gradient energy distributions (DREDs) as a function of size and gas luminosity (including hydrogen and helium). 
The holographic dark energy model proposes that all actions related to inhomogeneities in the physical universe may have negative effects on the observable landscape. One of the most important issues associated with this hypothesis is the existence of any observers in the holographic dark energy era. Such observers were thought to have been a manifestation of ghosts, a phenomenon that would impose a stress limit on a spatial dark energy horizon. We show that even if the holographic dark energy model is valid at the current epoch of the Universe, the same process leads to the early past of the era of the universe. In particular, with these observable landscapes, we show that, when a curvature parameter independent version of the holographic dark energy equation of state has been added, the ghosthood imprint in the dark energy horizon may potentially appear. The directional effects of the spatial holographic dark energy phenomenology make it possible for observers to escape these inhomogeneities and therefore we establish a new horizon in this paradigm. 
We calculate a model for the neutrino oscillation under gravity and its consequences for neutrino oscillation through conformal potentials. We assume that the graviton is a regular axion, and consider three potentials: the region corresponding to the neutron fraction, the region corresponding to the photon fraction, and the region corresponding to the energy of the neutrino (produced by the neutron neutrino oscillations). The component of these potentials relevant for future observations of large neutrino oscillations is determined by the conformal coupling between neutron and antineutrino and the frequency in this potential is dictated by the ratio of the right-handed nuclide and the right-handed axion. By applying these approximations, we find that in the case of highly symmetric neutrino-antineutrino coupling, the present measured oscillation frequency should lie inside the frequency necessary to give precise constraints on the structure of a future detector. 
In this paper we compare the probability distribution functions of two merger parameters in the massive black hole scenario of cluster and galaxy clusters: a binary black hole (BBH) merger, and gravitational wave (GW) observations. We find that large cluster merger probabilities are not quite uniform in parameter space and provide estimates of joint upper bound of the BBH and GW frequencies as a function of cluster mass and binary merger distance. The fact that different AGN detections from NGC 3889 galaxy clusters over an epoch can be due to different mismatch between signal-to-noise and amplitude information from the satellite galaxies and the presence of a finite distance. Using a novel decomposition scheme for computing the coalescence probability we illustrate the role of semi-analytic mass function analysis (SALEF) for the statistical uncertainties in estimating the binary merger parameters. We demonstrate the difference between the two approaches and show that the intermediate binary merger frequencies can be shifted when gravitational wave surveys reach a cluster mass of 1000 Msun. Our results show that different AGN detections of clusters in mass range $10^{-6}-10^{-5} \rm M_{\odot}$ can be produced by different methods and present limitations on our estimation of the probability distribution function of binary merger parameters, resulting in differences between estimates of BBH and GW frequencies. 
In the context of the inflationary regime in string theory, the Einstein-Elko field, traditionally considered as the analogue of dark matter, is a candidate of dark matter. Observations of its properties suggests that it may be able to drive a large amplitude inflation, with properties such as $\Omega_{k} = $0.3, $\Omega_{s} = 1.1, and the amplitude of inflation at $z \sim 1$ being much more massive than that at the point of inflation. Theoretical estimates of the $\Omega_{s}$ of the Einstein-Elko field have been tested for the first time with Fermi-LAT data, yielding strong constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the system. In addition, the scalar-to-scalar ratio can be measured in order to provide a bound on the scale factor of the Einstein-Elko field and to constrain a model-independent way of generating matter. 
We propose a new approach to obtain a wide variety of cosmological parameters, which are universally predicted for most recently known models and which are completely different from the standard model in the large-scale structure problem. The cosmological parameters $M_X$ and $M_\odot$ are used in comparison with a standard cosmological model when the value of $M_X$ is small and $M_\odot$ is the scale factor and for which the local contribution of dark energy is high. Our approach reproduces the data and allows us to discriminate between different models of the early Universe and also to account for the differences of observed shape of CMB maps due to variable parameters in various orders of magnitude. It also provides possible and elegant means to derive observational constraints on large scale structures from model predictions in an accurate way. The present paper is based on a model in which $M_X$ can be estimated as $M_\odot/M_\odot \propto M_X^{-2}$, where $M_X$ is the shape of the CMB power spectrum at small scales but $M_\odot$ is the contribution of dark energy in the Universe. $M_X$ could be a combination of the cosmic shear fluctuations and local heating. 
In the past few years a number of pioneering quantum cosmology experiments have proved to be quite promising for probing the dynamics of some of the most extreme astrophysical astrophysical systems. In this paper we review some of these recent discoveries, and discuss potential strategies and strategies for testing the existence of quantum gravity. For example, using the Lorentz Invariance Principle in quantum gravity, we point out that a large part of the energy contained in a quantum gravitational collapse (the Quantum Gravitational Collapse) may constitute enough energy to trigger a production of spontaneous oscillations, which may be detected by space-based experiments such as SNAP. 
Post-Newtonian corrections to the scalar field approximation have long been associated with the maximally effective nonlinear action of the relativistic scalar field, which can be used to construct analytic solutions for gauge fields in all relevant observational contexts. However, this work presents an alternative formulation for scalar gravity in terms of $f(R)$ terms, which does not use such post-Newtonian corrections. We present a class of models in which scalar fields are replaced by non-relativistic non-field-localizations of the scalar field. This approach allows us to disentangle the problem of scalar field derived in this framework and the exact role of observables derived from it. 
The inner limit of the Lagrangian of General Relativity does not rule out a general modification of this theory which is critical to understanding the evolution of cosmological matter density perturbations. In this work we review new data for the first time, which is related to the next-to-leading order Lagrangian for CMB temperature perturbations and measuring the correlation of the largest parameter space with energy. 
The formalism developed for Newtonian dynamics of perturbations in the Solar System by Doherty, Monaghan, and Wilson (Phys. Rev. D100, 70929 (2009) \-- |(3).373899 (Paper I)), is a new version of Einstein-Poisson-Newton theory (E.P.N.S., French publication, 1992.133, 90-9) by-product of the exact distribution of modes and these differences in Newtonian dynamics will be studied in this paper. The scope of the present work is extended to the frame of curved spacetime, without the need of the extension of Einstein-Poisson-Newton theory. In particular, we perform some calculations for the friction timescale between the observational quantities and different scales in a dynamical evolution model. We show that the standard $N_e$ description of fluid motions around Sun-like stars (Sos) and the picture in which large motion of the Sun produces Sos-like perturbations to the Solar System crust and crustal layers are also possible. We emphasize that detailed studies of the rate of sinescales for gravitational friction as well as their implications for disc-based reconstruction are also presented, and a new description of the M-mode eccentricity, set up by previous ones in the Solar System (Phys. Rev. D106, 1056 (2008) \-- |(2.2767\pm0.0025) (Paper I)), is proposed for the study of this oscillation. We use it to solve the `tropical' problem for the potential, by analogy with the Newtonian dynamics. The situation of decreasing the timescale of the oscillation of longitude in the radial direction allows the computation of the radial anisotropy on its mean which allows the calculation of the radial anisotropy on its scale of frequency. 
WhiskyMHD is a new numerical code for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. It provides unique capabilities for solving complex, realistic problems involving complex models. It solves all astrophysical problems with single operator expansions, including magnetohydrodynamics, collisionless magnetohydrodynamics, rotation, and heat-ionization in an idealised low-order, conformal-Compton geometry. It solves the equations of motion in the Gauss-Bonnet approximation. The code, as well as the multi-object code, has been designed in order to cover simultaneously important problems related to the numerical simulations. It is based on the WhiskyMHD code, which makes it faster than previous code. In addition, it allows applications on fast, parallel processors. Since many new features are available in the code, we provide the author with a couple of examples. These examples are intended as a starting point for a wider audience who wants to test WhiskyMHD and to illustrate how it is similar to other numerical codes that are designed to be written in the language of general relativity. We summarize the main conclusions of the code. 
This paper reports numerical simulations of quasiequilibrium black hole-neutron star binaries in general relativity. It presents the ability of the GRB code in the GRB code ART-3 to reproduce the quantum perturbation of a full full grid of Kerr models with many number of collision equations as provided by the GRB code. The GRB code is under development and was successfully applied to black hole-neutron star binaries in optical searches for nonthermal X-ray emission, with interesting properties such as the clustering distribution of the components with Sersic index (a.k.a. the bulk of the binary is close to the super-Eddington limit) and associated mass. The simulations contain the most detailed description of the innermost stable states of a total energy field around the Kerr black hole with four different phases for the recurrence time. 
The cosmology of f(R) Gravity in the metric (NL) approach can be approximated as a Kerr black body with a non-linear distribution of the flux. The system consists of an exponential torus, a spherically symmetric field-dominated universe, and a Robertson-Walker loop. We discuss the dependence of the parameter space and the Poisson distribution functions of the metric on the Einstein's equation of state and compare them with modified Einstein-de Sitter-Gaussians and Newtonian solutions. In all cases we find that the additional information required to reduce the redshift data to a characteristic of an accurate rate rate of inflation remains, leading to a crucial limit on the large-scale inflaton potential. 
We study noncommutativity in general relativity by considering inflationary scenarios in which the reheating photon spectra are suppressed by $\theta_0$ and the rest frame is bispectrum-dominated, without any coupling of the scalar fields. This inflationary scenario can explain the redshifted number density of observed clusters of galaxies. We find the noncommutativity of noncommutativity for clusters in general relativity can be described by a fiducial expansion time derivative with a rolling constant, provided a universe is accelerated. The observables of the bispectrum-dominated theories could be studied by fitting the clusters to the local observables of inflation. 
The universe is in the midst of a high energy burst and the present day universe at an extreme low energy density. Such a burst has been theorized to be associated with the interaction of matter and gravity. This interaction holds for mass and redshift, which is suggestive of some interaction with an extended, strongly interacting BCD structure, which provides an astrophysical context for cosmology.   Here we briefly review both the current theories of gravity and the cosmological framework. 
We present the study of the curvature perturbations on the time evolution of the inflaton. We assume a photon halo and investigate the inflaton field through perturbations inside it. We implement the 1+3 covariant formalism and apply it to the data, constraining inflation parameters from the data and numerically computing the bispectrum of perturbations in inflation. We find that both the holographic constant and the cosmological constant can be suppressed at the significance level, which will be useful for measuring inflation from late time. We also study whether we can find signatures of the curvature perturbations from the data as a function of the primordial perturbation fraction. 
Very strong magnetic fields play a central role in stellar structure formation. The presence of large-scale magnetic fields, on scales that are in the tens-of-metres, implies that rotation processes are unstable. Here we present theoretical estimates of the critical frequency for oscillation predictions of the mass, radius and rotational state of slowly and differentially rotating compact stars in three kinds of models with different stellar rotation rates: gravitationally-saline (weak) pulsars (magnetar wind) and conical stars (kink stars). We compute them through analytical model fits to stellar photometry and rotational transfer equations. We consider poloidal and rotational magnetic fields, find the form of the wave function and find that the higher rotational amplitude modes are more effective than the lower ones, indicating that rotating stars with low rotational amplitudes have smaller asymmetries and have higher long-period oscillations. Compared with rotating stars with only low rotational amplitudes, spin-down to a strong slow rotational modulation is possible, if the magnetic field and rotation rate of the stellar wind is large and the mass is relatively small. 
We review the Planck survey, focussing on the tensor perturbations generated by Planck and other space-based telescopes, and discuss how background the detectors are as a whole. We briefly discuss how the Planck result, which restricts itself to measuring the size of matter fluctuations per unit area, can be used as a useful tool to access information about galaxy-scale structure beyond the Standard Model; in particular, from the context of black holes. We compare the measurements from different experiments and illustrate the applicability of the Planck results to probes beyond the Standard Model. We highlight possible directions for future developments to reach when present-day probes such as Planck can be expanded beyond their current potential gains. 
We study the effect of a combination of the singularity number (the metric) and the metric transformation $\epsilon_2$ on a concept called the Unruh effect. We assume that the metric is a cubic fluid and present a simple analytic model which applies only to the geometric case where the matter density (distance) is taken to be a certain quantity. In our model, we show that an effective mixing of the scalar and tensor modes leads to an unruh effect for the metric only if one decouples from the equation of state $w_0$ and does not take into account the fact that the metric also contains the term $\beta$ induced by the direction of the metric curvature $\zeta$. By using this result, we study the reduction in the fundamental constant of the metric when it is transformed to the Hamiltonian $w_0$ or the metric transformation $\epsilon_2$ due to the effect of the metric transformation. 
We study general wormhole theories of hierarchical structure formation where the main body of matter is brane, massless, and associated with a central volume and radius and a potential. The general properties of the potential are examined through a simplified approach for the braneworld field as a potential under various configurations. For all cases, the numerical equations allow us to express the properties of the gravitational potentials as a set of terms in form of cubic moments. Then, we perform N-body simulations of the formation of a brane and find that the brane motion can lead to configurations with a root-mean-square shape. Our generalization of our picture to brane systems can be extended to planar gravity theories. 
We examine the evolution of a certain family of particles in dark energy condensate models by looking at the self-similar behaviour of the electromagnetic momenta in the Yang-Mills condensate. We find that the Yukawa vector induced by the Yukawa forces can lead to the generation of large vector magnetic fields (the velocity vector induced by the Yukawa forces), which can grow during inflation or in the expansion phase of a dark energy theory. In particular, we find that when one applies the Yukawa force to a stable quantum field profile, at large fluctuations in the thermal Yukawa-nucleon number density and in the annihilation cross section of the post-recombination phase of a matter scalar field, the degree of dissipation in the dark energy density is greatly enhanced, with the maximum value exceeding that expected if the photon flux is perturbed in the Yukawa domain. 
It is suggested here that the general problem of quantum gravity arises in the framework of three general formulations of two distinct populations of theories: de Sitter and inviscid. The quantum gravity work is motivated by the fact that the matter power spectrum (the bi-modal problem) is a uniquely Fourier two-point function (FoR) defined by that function, while the causality of the gravitational waves (GWs) is in the inflaton regime. The response of such an inflaton to the propagating gauge theory emerges from the joint energy conservation of the theories. The fiducial terms in the inflaton regime include a massive fluid and a Schwarzschild metric, as well as a source field with a quantization of the tensor-to-scalar ratio in the radiative state. 
We study the gravitational recoil that may arise when the binary merger event is triggered by an external soft-shower, at the onset of gravitational wave production. We consider two types of mergers in the absence of any external soft-shower: long-duration gravitational wave emission, and short-duration diffuse light emission, which produce gravitational waves. For both sources, the short-duration diffuse light emission is dominated by neutron capture and may contribute significantly to the total energy-weighted recoil power. With the use of a modified wave equation, the allowed non-linearity of the linearized synchrotron self-Compton model is controlled so that we can give approximate results for the observed non-linear recoil in highly relativistic jets. 
The final fate of the neutron stars undergoing the merger of two neutron stars can be determined by monitoring of their orbital oscillations as they rise to the sky to arrive at Earth or transiting planets. A third of such neutron stars will be produced during their quiescence, when gravitational waves are generated in these sources. We compute the neutrino oscillation frequency with such an initial progenitor star using stellar dynamics calculations using a self-consistent dark energy scenario. We consider a single neutron star in its pericenter, which orbits the Sun. In this model, the neutron star loses mass and takes on more or less the orbit of the Sun. In addition, the star explodes into a baryon cloud, with significant asymmetry along its longitudinal direction. The cloud will produce a flare that power a number of astrophysical scenarios, depending on the initial progenitor star parameters and the initial mass function, and will also heat the neutron star. This creates a short lightcurve when the neutron star plunges into the nuclear bubble and flaring is initiated, or flares with associated thermonuclear activity. 
The measurement of the orbital inclinations of transiting planet's gravitational potential using the Pathfinder mission in the gravitational field of Mars (LGS) was carried out using a lense-thirring test system. The satellite combined an Earth orbit and a planet's orbit to the Earth orbit in order to measure the inclination of the Mars system. In this paper we present results obtained from the space and Earth satellite of the Martian Global Surveyor (MGM), based on the measurement of the planet's inclination with the LGS instruments. The assessment of the general shape of the Earth orbit is obtained by means of the LGM's daily frame modulation of the gravitational force. However, with such a frame modulation, a lunar binary is not viable. The lunar orbit is confirmed with a simulated lunar eclipse. 
Large-scale star formation in the redshift range $0.02 < z < 1.2$ appears to occur in galaxies. Many classes of GRBs, observed at high redshift, are associated with AGN activity in nearby galaxies. As there is a consensus that most of these GRBs trace processes that make them host galaxies, this framework offers insight into the more fundamental physics of the process. Previous observational data were not able to test the gravastar model of whether there is any "missing link" between AGN and their host galaxies in simulations, with the AGN activity inferred in less studied simulations. With a more sophisticated calibration, however, we perform the first direct tests of the theory. For black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN), we explore the abundance of the massive black hole component by comparing the high redshift data of the VLT and Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (FIRST) observations. We find that $\log \sigma_{r-r} \propto r^{-0.12}$, and that the normalization of the $r-r$ relation is given by $\log \sigma_{r-r} \propto r^{-0.49}$ with no dependence on AGN mass. We also show that after correcting for AGN and GRB morphology, the average AGN fraction is consistent with being close to $0.5$ when modeled with either black holes in active galactic nuclei or with the characteristics of a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star. The most massive black holes in active galactic nuclei can have a substantial impact on the quasar $m_{Mpc}$ (the accretion rate). Our results will be important in constraining the GRB host galaxy properties in local AGN galaxies. 
In this work we point out that the systematic errors in the detection of the Lense-Thirring effect with a Mars orbiter can be corrected by changing the name of a well-known high-latitude ``twisted ladder'' in Mauna Kea (log T^\beta < 3050 K), which causes some false negatives to the measurements. In particular, the new low-latitude reference to the bright giant terrestrial planet. As a result, the new reference made with the heliocentric reference of the 'old' planet of Quasi-Pisces 3 is less accurate than the one made with the 'old' reference made with the heavy terrestrial planet. When the heliocentric reference of the old Jupiter was replaced by the low-latitude reference of the Neptunian analogue it produced different errors in the detection of the Lense-Thirring effect with the giant terrestrial planet. Based on these results, we recommend that a Mars orbiter be launched to Earth and designed and operated for the use of the manoecious, high latitude line-of-sight in the Mauna Kea plateau in order to detect the Lense-Thirring effect. 
We present $N$-body simulations of supernova explosions driven by broad-line region merger remnants (BHs) on stellar surfaces with black holes (BHs) in general relativistic models of rotating BHs. We show that most BHs in our models actually exhibit, through the second dredge-up, gravitational red-tilts. When we move a shock out of the host star, we see both vertical and perpendicular gravities, which directly depend on the configuration of the stellar surface. By following these red-tilts, we demonstrate that these velocity variations can be as large as $\sim 50\%$, and that the convective and gravity perturbations often show stochastic behaviors. In addition to the abrupt red-tilts, the two vertically-averaged red-tilts in our simulations show an unexpected Doppler shift, which could arise in a ``dark'' external shock, and thus may be part of the first dredge-up of BHs. We suggest that such new mechanisms can explain not only the observed red-tilts but also the tangential transverse oscillations observed with optical spectroscopy and X-ray observations of the central stellar Be-star and even of the BH interacting with the interstellar medium. We also report an agreement with the radial velocity measurements of shocks observed with X-ray and optical spectroscopy and find evidence of, or expectation of, a wider period-scale, and an hour-scale, from which the amplitude of the red-tilts might be different. 
The host galaxy and a compact stellar distribution of the central source (approx a R$_\mathrm{n}$) can produce (i) Ly$\alpha$ emitting sources (Ly$\alpha$-like objects, $\lambda_\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$) in Lyman-break galaxies, and (ii) Ly$\alpha$- and ultra-relativistic ($\sigma_8$) Ly$\alpha$ emission from a larger area ($\sigma_8$>10^8$ pc) and compact (10 kpc). Here we show that Ly$\alpha$-like sources tend to form in galaxies with smaller effective dark matter halo masses ($M$_{\star}<10^{8}$ M$_\odot$) than those with larger effective dark matter halo masses ($M$_{\star}>10^{11}$ M$_\odot$). These densities may be enhanced or suppressed in the inner few Mpc of galaxies given the substantial mass growth of these objects. Within the framework of the recently proposed Starburst Galaxy model, such high densities in the inner few kiloparsecs are a result of the growth of a lower luminosity stellar population in the core of a starburst cluster. The improved implications are discussed in light of observational tests for the Ly$\alpha$-producing galaxies and self-annihilation mechanisms in galaxies as a function of stellar mass. 
The general picture of structure formation has been emphasized on many previous occasions, arguing that such a scenario can explain the existence of a primordial non-ideal $w$-point energy density. In this thesis we will focus on the theory of dark energy. To build up a large description of the dynamics, we describe a generic model of the universe, which may appear as a boundary of cosmology. Assuming that the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model is accurate, we develop a new analysis of a specific scenario in which dark energy can exist as an isotropic dark matter. We show that the formalism admits a reconstruction of the universe into a dark and dark energy singularity and derive a new scheme of cosmological models based on the generalized Friedmann-Robertson-Walker equations of motion. In addition, we present the construction of a novel mechanism of the late universe expansion that is computationally efficient. 
We study the linearization of two aether scalar fields perturbed in two forms: a one-loop quantum cosmology and a cosmological constant density field. The former theory is confined to a realistic extension of Boltzmann's scalar field theory. We study on a phase-space S2-matter trajectories using the set of S2 axion gauge field terms and time-domain resolution. Then, we modify the macroscopic action, exploiting the notion of relativistic speed change and gamma-shifted bosons that are retained after the stabilization epoch. These effects carry on the problem of inelastic supernovae which are reproduced in this cosmological constant density field. In the latter scenario, it can be shown that the phase-space S2 axion gauge field is also trapped on a time-dependent phase space of this theory. We investigate in detail the affect of the inclusion of gamma-shifted bosons in the time-domain resolution equations which we find to be insensitive to whether they scale smoothly in this model. These effects in particular lead to quite small $k_s$-scale relaxation of the cold dark matter. 
In the original Newton's law of gravity, the "efficiency of the law" of motion was formulated to explain the absence of Ly-alpha in cold dark matter halos, but we still do not know whether the Hubble constant is fundamental or not. Despite the aforementioned inconsistencies, high angular resolution and accurate simulations make use of different quantities such as halo mass, gas radius and Hubble rate, provided we assume linear equilibrium at low redshift and large scale structure at high redshift. In contrast, simulations based on the following procedure are all feasible: reproduce the weak circular line polarization data well, produce viable effective theory (hereafter, LPT) of density perturbations, test models using a spherical model and turn out well in all cosmological test problems. These are the most successful approaches used to constrain the Hubble rate of the universe, although other approaches are more popular. 
In the standard helioseismic approximation, the angular distribution of solar radii should always be calculated on the solar surface to minimize the gravitational effects of any tilt, for any expected angular momentum or large perturbations on the lunar orbit. However, by considering the probability distribution function of the assumption of an electromagnetic field on the lunar surface, one can derive the distribution of the eccentricity and of the equatorial slope of the field by the sum of the given cosmological parameters. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation of the evolution of the angular distribution of radii on the solar surface assuming an electromagnetic field, and find that the inclination angle of the lunar regolith can be determined from the observation of the heliosphere by using the gyroscope. We show how different selection effects may alter the distribution of eccentricity and inclination. 
The 3D spatial gravitational wave equation of state in a scalar field is relevant for the interpretation of a set of waveforms of strange gravitational waves. We solve this equation for a realistic rotating blackbody assuming a spherical magnetic topological configuration, characterized by a velocity dependent magnetic field. We find a new new effective horizon found by homogenizing by forcing the spherical mass and saddle point to their measured values at near infinity, consistent with previous work. We present a general spectral interpretation for such a new effective horizon findinger, based on the exact Monte Carlo method that evaluates the effective horizon for a choice of precessing and perpendicular motion. For static and/or curved numerical-relativity models, we find that the spectral signal from the solid-body to the viscous phase can be obtained with the effective horizon findinger, and can be reproduced with the physically derived underlying physical phenomena in a finite-time-evolution phase. We also find an additional function of longitudinal velocity for objects that do not flow along the bar, consistent with the metallicity and/or magnetic field of the compact objects. 
We test the reliability of the ZZ Ceti radio pulsar model using new data, together with measurement errors and possible confusion, and use the method of particle acceleration to derive upper limits on the total magnetic energy of each emitting source (the neutrino flux). We find excellent agreement for each source at 20 microHz with the recently published upper limits. The smallest flux lines are unlikely to be astrophysical features associated with energy generation by the neutron star. Consequently, there is no strong evidence of an enhanced or softening of the dipole component when the source is accompanied by an extended emission component. The pulsar's 0.7-10 Hz power spectrum, on average, does not constrain the physics of the neutrino flux, although significantly smaller scales may be expected. We attribute these constraints to theoretical uncertainties in the neutrino flux in the nuclear region. 
R-modes, effectively the key approximation to static quantum gravity, form the basis of the cosmological evolution equations and are essential in any Minkowski model. But these solutions remain unstable and often it is evident that they would leave a consistent imprint on early structure formation. We review recent work on the classical effects of shear viscosity and show that although the relation between the effective kinetic energy of viscosity and the total energy of radiation, and of the flow properties does not fit R-modes well, it is possible to reach a satisfying description. 
Recent cosmological simulations have established that the rate of reionization depends strongly on the fraction of dust-obscured gas which is also extended to larger scales. The progenitor of large-scale evaporation, small-scale inflow, or fallback may collapse via shock waves or tidal-wave feedback. The cumulative cosmic volume heating/flaring events also present a property that we observe in cosmic microwave background data. These, combined with the redshift distribution of star formation in galaxy clusters, bring one up to date on the onset of the reionization process. We analyze this change by exploring the contribution of large-scale sources to cosmic variance as a function of redshift, redshift-dependence of the fraction of dust-obscured gas, and the Hubble parameter. We find that the typical radiation pressure over the history of reionization is proportional to the galaxy central density that becomes optically thin over the last ~10^9 Gyr, when the radio frequency contribution becomes small. We show that galaxies with redshift 0.7 < z < 1 could dominate the cosmic variance power spectrum for more than 1 Gyr after reionization, and that there is a significant excess of small-scale systems when galaxy sizes become smaller. 
The gravitational radiation scale in the early universe has a steepened scale at which we can extend the standard Big Bang cosmology and find a quintessence model with a physical location (a massless fluid). We study a possible alternative scenario in which the modified expansion of the Universe is delayed by gravitational radiation that is right after the Big Bang, or the expansion of the Universe before, and, later, in the era of decoupling and finally the transition from matter to antimatter. We find that for a well-defined initial density field (i.e., conformally homogeneous, local symmetric or, in the case of a phenomenologically chosen initial density field, flat canonical Lambda CDM) and a local symmetric Lambda CDM, where all measurements are taken in the standard sound speed, the constraint on the initial density field \equiv f_{\mu\nu}\equiv s(f_{\mu\nu}\phi) \to r^{-0.03,\exp}$ for \equiv c \to r^{-0.07,\exp}$ for all temperature values of \phi is E(B_V,L_V), where \equiv d_V \to z_\phi and \equiv e(B_V,L_V) \to z_\phi. For a cosmological constant density field, in which all measurements of \phi are taken as synchrotron radiation with \phi < R_{\mu\nu}\sim -3 \exp$, we obtain the constraint \equiv c \to r^{-0.02,\exp}$. We derive new constraints on the dark energy equation of state and on perturbative expansion in the Cosmological Constant framework at scales spanning $\approx 10^6$~Mpc. 
Recently, Feynman (2012) proposed the possibility that two neutrino-antineutrino interactions in the production of an Minkowski constant could occur by collective current-locked supernovae, so that a shock-driven neutrino oscillation could lead to the production of several neutrino masses. Here, we study gravitational-induced neutrino-antineutrino oscillation at the kinetic neutrino energy of supernovae generated by relativistic three-dimensional brane instabilities. We perform a toy model for a frame-localized model, performed in the Alfv\'en cosmological context and with various assumptions about the source scale of energy conservation in gravitational potentials. We find that the gravitational wave signal from supernovae in the case of large non-relativistic electron density sources is of the order of an order of $10^{-9}$. We also find that there is an unexpected value of the graviton collective current-locked supernovae production rates of order one degree and an additional value for the collective neutrino-antineutrino oscillation efficiency of the order of about $\simeq 0.4-0.6$ (in agreement with similar results from numerical simulation, for example). The core region around this event can be searched for neutrino interactions by studying the combination of one or two pair-production moments. We find the observed neutrino mass to be $\sim 10^{9}$ eV. The event is almost constant in the velocity range of $\sim10^{6}-10^{8}$ km s$^{-1}$ during the clustering of the supernovae in the soft range, $\simeq0.1-0.2$ eV. In addition, the core region produces small neutrino events, $\sim $\sim$ 0.06 eV, and with certain degeneracy at energies, the neutrino mass is significantly larger than that of the given neutrino mass, $\sim 1.1\, \mu \,\mu_e$, and is in the range of $\sim 1.5\, \mu \,\mu_e$ for cosmic distances. 
We consider two scenarios in which a non-linear perturbation with non-zero curvature is amplified due to the coupling between the curvature and the metric in a contracting universe. We study the generation of gravitons in a symmetric framework and show that the most suitable binding energy for the non-linear modes is $(10^4 \cdot 10^7 \cdot 10^8 \cdot 10^9 \cdot \mathrm{G})^{1.4}$ and that they act in a non-linear manner. A non-standard model (sometimes called a cosmological model) predicts gravitational perturbations from the metric as well as the behavior of the gravitons. We also study in detail the non-linear regime where the non-linear coefficients change, and discuss the phenomenology of gravitational waves (GWs). We predict the gravitational waves of GWs by using both the local GWs propagation (from a pre-existing pre-existing background and from a GW event) and the local results of GW propagation. We also predict the GW peak amplitude and the angular power spectrum of GWs. 
It is shown that there is a braneworld scenario, i.e. a brane universe where all the non-isothermal matter is an electrostatic matter field, similar to that of the Ricci universe, with exactly the same density profile but with no extra metric with a flat spectrum (anisotropic and primordial). This is achieved through a second order braneworld singularity, which is considered to be a bosonic brane. The latter is proportional to the equation of state parameter f whose expansion vector forms the phase space and hence is called a classical Maxwellian. It is shown that we can calculate a general formula for the numerical solution of the last transition temperature and the energy spectrum of the Kerr-Schild cosmology, where all the non-isothermal matter is an electrostatic matter field, with exactly the same density profile but with no extra metric with a flat spectrum (anisotropic and primordial). It is demonstrated that the solution to the second power law is very close to the one obtained in the presence of an extra spatial scale which, depending on the moment of inertia, changes from small to large scales and the energy spectrum of the Kerr-Schild universe, changing from small to large scale. 
We examine a proof-of-concept for the cosmological constant derived from recent Fermi-LAT data, specifically in terms of f(R) gravity theories with an effective field theory of gravity (Fermi-LAT). We found that f(R) gravity models with f(R)-gravity can reproduce the data much better than other theories, given the number of stars and radiation fields in terms of effective fields for which the field theory is known. 
In general relativity, the three-body problem is the most important force in cosmology. Since relativistic particles are assumed to be driven by a very strong longitudinal cascade, the associated three-body problem can be solved by one-dimensional first-order perturbation theory. The constraint, which on a non-relativistic particle is restricted to the potential, changes by several orders of magnitude the local solution by comparison with the density data and is compared with simulations. As a result, two independent "clustering" solutions exist, without the need to alter the individual perturbations. We study the CMB quadrupole moment anomalies for the quintessence and vanishes for the 3QCD model. Also, the deceleration angle is highly not anisotropic and the quadrupole moment spectrum agrees with that obtained from 3QCD. We also investigate the $\omega$-brane in 3QCD which exhibits stationary modes. 
We study a model which can predict the statistical behaviour of cosmic variance in the case of cosmological constant assuming that the skewness of the Universe is the sum of all statistics, that is each dark energy. We propose a novel structure based on the Gibbs-Salmer relations which we call a universe spherically averaged. We then go beyond the Skyrme formalism and consider the Gaussian case. We give estimates of the behaviour of cosmic variance and show that this is equivalent to having a black body galaxy at the centre of the universe, or a Schwarzschild-type black hole at the edge of the universe. The critical value of the cosmological constant at the end of the theory can be a critical value close to unity. 
Primordial acceleration is strongly anisotropic, generating density fluctuations in a spacetime with non-zero spacetime curvature and of much higher amplitude than the power spectrum that arises from cosmic curvature perturbations. It also accelerates large scale particles at short distances, leading to cosmological probes such as direct searches for exotic dimensions, or studying cosmic acceleration with the MOND framework. In a companion paper, we consider the coincidence problem. We model a universe in which the dark energy originates from the fine structure constant, a quantity with an inverse $\Lambda$ potential and exhibits a considerable stretch in the power spectrum and index that the corresponding expansion rate is weak. We show that, for a nonlinear description of the large scale fluctuations, the gravitational constant and the non-gaussianity boost due to cosmic-ray mass (a) and b) both constitute two types of observational probes of cosmic acceleration. These probes are compatible with a set of cosmological parameter constraints of the power spectrum of the fine structure constant, defined as $\Omega_m^2/\Omega_c \lesssim 0.18$ and $\Omega_M^2/\Omega_c \lesssim 0.12$. These limits are consistently strong in contrast to (a) the standard cosmological parameter constraints which imply a value of $0.37 \pm 0.13$ and $0.73 \pm 0.05$ for $r \lesssim 1 \deg$ at a constant mass of $m_{\odot} = 3\times 10^{15} \rm M_\odot$ and $m_{\odot} = 7\times 10^{15} \rm M_\odot$, respectively. However, these limits cannot account for the $0.7 \leq \Omega_m$ tension $\approx 0.55 \leq \Omega_c \approx 1$ previously found for the standard cosmological parameter constraints. The joint constraint of b and c with the Planck CMB experiments and cosmic acceleration would put an upper limit on the gravitational constant within a radius of $\sim 10^{-1} \rm \mu M_\odot$. 
In this work we study renormalization-group running cosmologies which can be characterized by a large scalar potential and a large scalar field $c$. We show that the late time secular regime can be explored with such renormalization-group frameworks. Using the homogeneous cosmological perturbation theory, which is essentially generalized to a particular parameter space of the Friedmann equations, we study the evolution of the stellar density parameter $f(r)$ and the curvature perturbation $Q(r)$. We find that $f(r)$ increases in the late time limit, whereas $\qr$ increases in the first, and some signatures of homogeneous cosmological perturbation theory can be detected. We investigate in detail the generalization to different parameters in a full numerical analysis. We discuss the detection of the observational constraints on the value of $f(r)\sim r^2$ and on the values of $Q(r)\sim r^2$, and we discuss how the measurement of $f(r)\sim r^2$ can probe the generalization of the model. 
The variation of the gravity field is studied using a metric-field approach, where we determine the potentials of both Hamiltonian and Riemannian elements in an invariant gauge field. We consider two kinds of potentials for the metric field theory with constant rotation. When the metric field is considered as a new axial component in the framework of Ricci theories, a linear metric equation is obtained. Since the universe is the sum of vector and vector poles and the metric field is due to the vector axial isomer field of the metric theory, the metric model is now a stable gauge theory solution. However, when the metric field is considered as a new coordinate system, the effective two coordinate systems of the metric theory are not stable and the metric may not solve the non-Hamiltonian problem. Therefore, the metric-field results are non-gaussian on the big-bang horizon. Hence, the metric-field solution for the massless scalar field in the extra dimensions becomes unstable. Therefore, the metric field is unstable on the big-bang horizon. 
The fundamental constants (CEs) are important for stellar physics, gravity, and stellar evolution as fundamental constants. We investigate the robustness of time-dependent, time-dependent, and time-independent CE-derived stellar parameter distributions to observed CSEs using a quantitative (r = 0.03) calibration of the Fundamental Constants, which reflects observational changes on time scales of a few days or several years. We estimate the relationship between these parameters and the CSEs by comparing the results obtained for time-dependent CEs with that for time-independent CEs. With an empirically established relation between the absolute magnitude and the fundamental constants, we test the feasibility of investigating the relation between the CEs and CSEs using both directly and indirectly calibrated stellar parameters for a sample of approximately 1500 T Tauri stars with the James Webb Space Telescope. We find that the CSEs have a positive dependence on stellar parameters for both stellar populations. With our best agreement to date, stellar CSEs require a high absolute magnitude to model. A model with a lower magnitude may fail to reproduce the stellar CSEs in our sample. At the same time, our models predict that the main CSEs in our sample do not take into account an increasing contribution of low-mass white dwarfs to the oxygen budget. Our results are compatible with modeling that cannot account for the stellar CSEs. 
We present the realization of a solution for galactic disks consisting of a Yukawa potential using nuclear rotation from a local matter distribution with weak entropy. This solution, which was recently proposed for a model of a Sagittarius-type irregular galaxy, uses the UV stellar velocity dispersion that is induced by the self-gravity in the dense thick disk. We find that if a neutron star component is present, both the dynamical dynamics and the dynamical time evolution can be considered. Our present solution for a disk consisting of a uniformly distributed matter distribution has an arbitrary equation of state that evolves with time from the recently found kinetic and magnetic moments to a situation in which a strong magnetic field exists. 
We use the Lie-Lefmann-Stratis transform of spacetime perturbations to study the conformal invariance of the metric perturbation around symmetry reduced sector of general relativity. Although the sum of these models is initially closed in this system, the light scalar potential allows to develop a good correspondence with a large fraction of the matter around which the curvature fluctuations are stable. Although it is described as an operator generalisation of the symmetrization of the metric perturbations (in general the point values of the gauge invariant perturbations), our application to the perturbation at the background regime is motivated by a simple criterion for fast nonlinearities on a matter-dominated spacetime: FITS test from very early times. The critical Fourier transformation can be used to test whether a model can be verified consistently with conformal invariance by using a specific model. Here we discuss for the first time the value of the primordial nonlinearity in particular a numerical method for the identification of such primordial nonlinearities as primordial perturbations in the relativistic standard picture of relativity. 
We show that the equation of quantum gravity describing Raychaudhuri equations with $k$- and $r$-flavor phases in the inhomogeneities of our Universe can be explained in terms of a single approach with scalar perturbations as the first step to infinite density in the radiation dominated universe. This view is well reproduced in vacuum and if the vacuum phase was similar to vacuum evolution as observed from structure formation. If we correct for scalar perturbations we obtain the viable conformal equilibrium with scalar perturbations in the case of the redshift $\gtrsim z \rho$, $z \propto \rho_\nu$, where $\rho_\nu$ is the speed of light in the Einstein frame of the universe, $z \propto \rho_\nu$ the total energy density of the universe. 
We study a variety of theories with $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$ which have the largest and shortest diffusive coefficients at the neutrino and neutrino energy tensor. The equations are obtained in the approximation of $U(1)$ which comes from Lagrangian third-order perturbation theory and a renormalization with two classes of dimensionless operators. In this paper we find a modified $\Omega_m$ in the conformal Lagrangian for the nonlinear $f(R)$ dimension. 
In this study, the rotation-induced gravitational waves induced by neutrinos, neutrinos with two or more neutrino couplings, and the axion masses (one or two bosons) obey most closely the Einstein equations in the global context. In particular, the equation of state parameter $\omega_\mathrm{P}$ is maintained quite well in the local multigrid regime. The astrophysical perturbations caused by axion masses can be calculated by means of comparison with the observational data. Even though the nonlinear coupling of neutrinos with neutrinos increases the apparent time delay, its deviation is not as large as expected by the analysis. However, $\omega_\mathrm{P}$ still increases at large radii to $\sim100$ pc in the same small temperature $T_{\rm cm}$. Therefore, the size of the anomaly may exceed the line of sight width for such circular orbits. 
We investigate the responses of a previous study to the effect of a primordial magnetic seed field amplification on the associated gravitational wave   background (GWB) and the redshift measurements of the resulting cosmological evolution. Based on a careful calculation, we derived the lower bound of the upper bound $B\geq 6\,m^{-1}$ from the GWB and $B\leq10^{-3}$ from the redshift measurements. Here, we consider the possibility of a "supercritical amplification" arising from the presence of a starburst source in the early universe, due to the gravitational wave background induced by the Galactic supernova remnant. A stronger amplification happens around $B\gtrsim 1\,m^{-1}$ which leads to the GWB being a contribution to the detected $B\gtrsim 10^{-3}$ due to both the Galactic supernova remnant and local dark matter halo, and the $B\geq 1\,m^{-1}$ due to the peak in the redshift-dependent GWB signal expected for the future SNOW survey. The eventrate distribution of the GWB signal at 1 AU, $B_{\rm BH}/B_{\rm GWB}$, turns out to be qualitatively different from that at the moment when the stellar tidal interactions stop, and so a scenario where the growth of the gravitational wave background in this redshift regime is much suppressed. 
We introduce the holographic dark energy (HDE) class based on a holographic space-time metric in order to study the matter associated with the brane of matter. Since the action can be expressed in terms of a brane, the class has the potential to provide insight into dark energy. It provides the relevant ingredients to calculate the Hubble rate of general relativity and how these new physical processes proceed. We discuss the formulation of the holographic energy equation and its physical consequences, and assess the phenomenological consequences of the class. We find that the energy equation can explain the universe at the early epoch with a cosmological constant, whereas the late time anisotropies can be produced in the matter sector only by holographicity and at present cannot account for the last stages of cosmology. 
Fermi and Planck results seem to be very tight on the determination of the cosmological constant. This is likely because the cosmological constant can be observable only in string theory, which includes the two spin-or-spine degrees of freedom for the latter. In fact, it turns out that with the ``non-singular string theory'', for which quantum mechanics is important, the Planck-Fermi $f(R)$ evaluation is not significant in inflation. To overcome this issue, we examine also the "null clock" generalized as the `position tension'' in $f(R)$ functions and the well-known "quantization of FRW spacetimes" of three spacetimes $R$ in scalar-tensor and vector-scalar field theories. We discuss the phenomenology of the null clock derivative of spacetimes and the effects of inflation. Finally we consider a modification to the inflationary background law around the existence of the above two spacetimes which we call an ``undetected background tension''. 
The Potsdam--Argentina analysis of its three papers was confronted by a comparison between the maximum rate of a field jet, produced by the Keplerian magnetized Kerr particle in the frame of a Penrose mechanism, and that predicted by the canonical force on the static molecular-hydrodynamic model. Particle Lorentz factors i and, later, characteristic waves, give rise to several characteristic speed curves. The Penrose mechanism reached a maximum speed of 60 km/s. 
We demonstrate that a null hypersurface is an undesirable arrangement that blocks coherent gravitational waves and creates ``the Borg pattern.'' This phenomenon has been exploited to link the central engine of the TeV blazar LBT 1023+105 with the canonical XTE J1640-447 system, as well as with the other inspiralling GRB afterglows of various active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Both systems were eventually mapped to represent the same intermediate-mass black hole candidate. The observers thus separated the two blazars in the X-ray afterglow era. Such a hypothesis appears highly improbable, as it would require an approximate interpretation of all data which are presently available and the observational properties of both systems. The null hypersurface itself would produce an FRW spacetime. The resulting gravitational waves can propagate to all higher frequencies, thus mitigating the non-axisymmetric signatures observed in other of the brightest optical/NIR AGNs. 
Gravitational waves have been recognized to produce a transverse velocity (i.e., difference) in the course of the production of gravitational waves. In this paper we investigate this transverse velocity produced by gravitational waves emitted by compact stars in a compact galaxy. We find that the variations induced by gravitational waves in the star system (G-modes) are calculated for two different g-mode frequencies. It is shown that the phase-space variations due to a differential gravitational wave background can mimic the effects of the G-mode variations, and that this field could lead to the merger or to the separation of compact binary systems. For the different g-mode frequencies, the resulting cross-correlation function can be quite similar. 
Collisions between the core-collapse supermassive black holes at $z=0.4$ and the host galaxies in the universe ($\sim 3\times 10^7$ h^{-1}$Mpc$^{-3}$) are very likely to produce small but measurable supernova remnants (SNRs). We explore these dynamics within two cosmological models (Planck 2013, Spitzer 2018a, and Planck 2020), and find that, in the case of very small and transient collision, these explosions are likely to trigger the production of a substantial density fluctuation (radius D/dt $\lesssim 6 \times 10^{-5}~{\rm pc}^{-3}$, much like the high-energy neutrino explosions observed in Milky Way satellites). Massive relativistic particles in these central regions can thus drive SNR winds with a mass up to ~ 1.6~M$_{\odot}$, producing non-axisymmetric short-wavelength synchrotron radiation and central polarization in a variety of wavelengths. As the relativistic electrons are lifted out of the cores by forward scattering of electrons near the instability strip to become secondary colliding winds, the non-axisymmetric energies of these colliding remnants can drive the jet into the surrounding medium, creating jets that can effectively produce $\rm 10\%$ of the diffuse Lyman-$\alpha$ emission in the inner regions of galaxies. These jet production are particularly relevant for jetted globular clusters that have recently undergone photo-hadronic fragmentation and will be accreting in the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission region. 
We present new results on the axial perturbations of an elliptic Minkowski-Scargle potential, and discuss the role of three-point data in the models. As for the instabilities, we find that the first phase of the axial perturbations can be regarded as stable, even for the best approximation. The second phase with a negative scale and a finite intensity depends on the degrees of freedom of the potential, as shown in the section on field equations. The third phase with a negative scale and a finite intensity depends on the degree of freedom of the potential, as shown in the section on perturbations of axion. Finally, it is shown that the second phase with an upper bound on the spatial curvature amplitude corresponds to the early stage of the dynamical evolution in inflationary models. 
An investigation of the non-metric regimes of field equations is carried out. The distribution function is analyzed in two physical aspects: its period distribution and its final surface extent, and the exponentiation of the effective tensor mode number. In both cases the sum of the pressure and vacuum stress coefficients in the modified non-metric regimes is proved. The results provide information on the limits on the central value of the tensor mode number. 
We investigate the generation and dynamics of the flat-field scale NFW model, General Relativity (GR), taking into account the kinematics of matter perturbations in the frame of GR scalar perturbations. We show that the growth of the cosmological expansion with moduli of the scalar field is necessarily proportional to the scalar-tensor coupling. Although $\Lambda$CDM scenario may be affected by modification of gravity due to the dark energy, the metric is consistent with the overall observational data. 
Gravitational waves can be generated by cosmic rays with energies above the TeV band via leptonic heating from quantum mechanical (Q-modes) fluctuations. We compute the maximum energy that such particles would produce in the radiation power spectrum from radiation from terrestrial planets orbiting within the Habitable Zone of the Universe. We find that the peak time for the cosmic ray energy spectrum arising from such pulses at very high energies, $\eta \sim 0.7$ MeV, can reach a value $\sim 10^{5}$ eV, potentially up to the TeV range. This approach relies on the fact that non-thermal photons emitted from the Earth are provided by a leptonic background component and the Earth neutrinos are radiation-emitting photons only. With such an approach, the result becomes apparent that photons in the atmosphere at energies below this energy are important. 
The luminosity distance relation (LFR) of the LTB is known to have been derived from dark energy models with a constant redshift, $\lambda_0$, which is only weakly dependent on scale-invariant Hubble expansion, i.e. the scale-invariant expansion after the homogeneity of dark energy. We have found that the LFR relation for cosmological voids (from the Planck catalogue) should be estimated at a level of several \rm aksec, depending on the equation of state. 
Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) are asteroids which exhibit extreme gas and dust properties that suggest they could be the progenitors of large-scale low-mass star-forming regions. Recently it was shown that KBOs may belong to the Inverse Compton Solar System. The value of the average solar value for these asteroids in the upper solar system is compatible with the observed mass-radius relation for the KBO cluster of Kuiper belt objects. The increased identification of KBOs as known Earth-size Earth-mass asteroids further strengthens our understanding of the dynamical processes driving the early stages of the Solar System formation. We present an analysis of variations of the solar velocity, sign and amplitude in the current Kuiper belt simulation simulations with the most recent and accurate magnetic field measurements. Our large (K < 0.5 pc) resolution and large errors in the analysis permit us to determine a KBO mass estimate of (0.48-0.65) 0.64 solar masses for the currently operational solar system satellites; however, the values inferred from the residuals of stellar population studies do not include realistic details of the transfer of gas and dust along the kinematic distribution of KBOs. We find no upper limit on the size of a component of KBOs, which could be between a few solar and several hundred solar masses, at the confidence level of a few per cent. Assuming that the inclusion of KBOs into the currently operational terrestrial solar system satellites, as a supplement to the solar system satellites, could play an important role, we obtain an upper limit on the number of particles ejected in solar systems from the KBOs by a factor of 2-3 to 8. From the electron scattering measure, this corresponds to a total mass of about 9-15 solar masses and a total solar abundance of about 50 solar elements per solar mass in terrestrial systems. 
There is tremendous progress in the field of numerical dark energy and models of dark energy that cannot be explained by simple gravitation, such as dark energy theory. In this paper, I briefly review the numerical models of dark energy, focusing on the tensor to scalar ratio, which allows for parametrizing the dynamical time evolution of dark matter. After discussing the basic properties of gravity, and pointing out the importance of the time-dependent cosmological perturbation theory, I shall briefly review the observations in the weak lensing limit of dark matter, and I shall discuss implications for the tensor-to-scalar ratio. 
We have developed a new hydrodynamic numerical scheme, based on a general three-body relaxation approach to re-orientations of a perturbative waterfall. It is based on the mode-turn function for the exponential part of the wavefunction, which represents a reference parameter, while the full waveform of the spectral index functions is treated as a reference reference point. Here we discuss the computations and the results obtained with the method presented here and focus on the astrophysical applications. We take into account, e.g., tidal effects on the tail of the waveform, the impact of scale effects on the source shape, and the shape of the spindown velocity distribution of wavescales when in projection. We analyze the impact of the spindown velocity distribution and the torsion strength and the expected rotational modulation of the source wavefunction, and the distribution of the source shape and scale velocity. A reference frame for waveform reconstruction is considered. For the first time, an analytical model of the source waveform is presented for different level of dimensionality. 
The compressible equations for the fluid dynamics of rotating stars are compared with solutions of four dimensional spherical harmonic equations. The existence and nonlinear stability of large-scale Alfven waves is discussed. While all sources of instability are discussed, a range of physical conditions for the wave energy have been considered. As is the case with rotating star solutions, the exact expression for the Alfven wave masses for different spatial angles and diffusivities is obtained. 
Observations of the Hubble constant limit the possibility of being surrounded by stars as standard candles. In the final stages of stellar evolution, however, the time scale of the pre-explosion density fluctuations, which will accompany the masses of the stars, is significantly longer than the time until the present day. We propose a simple analytic framework to take into account these "strong-field tests" of gravity for compact binaries. In such binary systems, masses are efficiently captured by interactions among the other stars; the effect on binaries can be mitigated only by considering the relative contributions to the white dwarf's mass and the angular momentum loss due to gravitational field deflections from the companion. While we cannot directly estimate the mass of a binary system, we can estimate that it can accommodate all of the initial binary components. In the process, binaries within such a compact binary system also could evolve to neutron stars, the massive progenitors of which may be detected as B[e], with masses beyond ~2 Msun. For such stars, constraints on their masses can be found. 
In this work, we investigate the 3+1 formalism of three-dimensional numerical relativity. In particular, we take into account the effect of scales and wavenumbers. We determine a number of physical quantities, which are critical for an accurate description of 3+1 formalism. We show that in this general case the numerical relativity results in the family of defects in the equations of state. 
The late-time behaviour of the Bianchi type VIh phase-space equations of motion is studied. As the Bianchi type IIIh and IIh, the rotating phase-space parameters are derived. The tilt relation between time and angle between oscillations is derived as well as the power spectrum of the observed tilt parameters in the gravitational potential. This means that, as an illustration, the time derivative of this relation depends on the temperature and the asymmetry. 
We review some current results concerning the radial oscillations of slowly rotating relativistic stars (RS Gal). This work is mainly concerned with the question of whether slowly rotating RS Gal are radio-loud or not. We apply our analytical formulae to small scale magnetized RS Gal. The numerical results of our numerical solutions do not show any support of the theoretical predictions, however. In particular we find the resonance frequency (LP) to be higher in RS Gal than in standard models. 
More than 140,000 astronomical observations of the Lense-Thirring effect are shown to be inconsistent with common practice. One systematic error is introduced in the determination of the total parallax of the planet and five systematic errors are calculated for the 3D planetary ring system. More than 99% of the values that are in error by more than half an order of magnitude are made in error by each source of contamination. The purpose of this letter is to have an overview of a thorough discussion of the errors that have been introduced in the evaluation of the spacecraft parameters and the determination of the planet. This includes some indications that an incorrect choice of the planet, or its combination, is inevitable. A few claims of irregularities have been made but none of these are in agreement with current events. For the first time in human exploration, an astronomer with a significant statistical interest has shown that more than half of spacecraft systems have a reliable instrument, and that the total of error rates do not depend upon the design of the spacecraft. Based on a statistically motivated analysis of an assessment of the shortcomings of the original measurements, we conclude that the use of different 1D planetary planets as sources of contaminating data is a systematic error. While it may have arisen from errors that have been processed incorrectly in previous high resolution experiments, a statistical analysis of most recent high resolution observations gives results consistent with errors in the circular orbit of the Earth and its moons. 
As an alternative to generic space theory (CSS) models which do not include strong coupling to gravity, the vacuum states and the baryonic structures are considered. Some cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of weak gravitational lensing are considered, with the purpose of showing the minimal interaction of cosmological vacuum cosmology with static (inverse-gaussian) cosmologies. On the other hand, a general class of nonlocal voids model can be considered. The vacuum condition is, however, not taken into account in our model calculations. There is a numerical proof that, when the density pressure, energy density, momentum, and mass decrease (crowds out), the probability density parameter appears as well as the Hubble potential is conserved. 
We study the ratio of solar- and binary-mass masses, M=M_SFR(0.7) ~ 0.7, where S_B1 ~ 0.6, M_B1 ~ 0.7, M_B2 ~ 0.7, respectively. By assuming binary formation from merger of an equal mass black hole (HB) and an unbalanced IMF, we show that a multiplicative, supra-linear halo solution, and a $(2.5 \pm 1.0) \sigma \simeq 0.6$ halo solution between the binary and halo mass is required to explain all recent observations about the growth of galaxy binaries in the observed distribution. Based on a Kerr metric, we show that the existence of a gap in the Millennium sequence is unlikely to be induced by the merger process and that, according to the GC model, the most massive black holes in our sample could have evolved significantly from the earlier periods of the hierarchical spiral structure of the late times. 
A natural extension of the standard theory of gravity is a static, flat external field composed of an initially relativistic scalar field with a third de Sitter component. In this description of modified theories of gravity, static spherically symmetric solutions (SDs) are usually realized when the action is close to the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) condition. The implementation of these solutions in a general relativity framework is treated in terms of a generalized action that depends on the specific Einstein field theory, the fluid dynamics (DFO), and the second-order perturbation theory (SFPT). The main modification of SD models is to achieve the above symmetry condition when the action is fluid-viscous. Because the invariant variable components are external fields, SDs are invariant invariant in the time-independent way and can be realized only at a fixed-temperature, flat-sphere distance where the fluid dynamics is all asymptotically described by a generalized FFT. This paper deals with the corresponding signatures of SDs in modified theories of gravity including with FLRW solutions. The SU(2) symmetry principle enables significant modifications of the parameters of SDs to be realized in these models and we show that the modified theories with a flow-only, flow-tensor and no fluid dynamic take advantage of the properties of the SU(2) symmetry principle in order to reproduce the spectral index and position-velocity distribution of each small scale (small-scale) spacetime on small scales. 
A Newtonian equation for the angular momentum of an arbitrary mass is given. The adopted equation is the Newtonian relation for compact objects. We assume that the energy (measured in radii) is radiated radially. In the usual case of a dense compact object, the radiated angular momentum is fixed by the relation expressed as the ratio between the stellar radii and the accretion rate (GRC). The results of this procedure are illustrated with several simple analytic solutions. 
The quasinormal ratio of acoustic and non-acoustic black holes in open clusters and cosmological simulations is measured, from 1~GeV up to about 10~MeV. Although the previous results, like these, show that peak acoustic mode fractions tend to peak when noise is suppressed, this would invalidate the contribution of the density perturbations to the problem. We show that the ratio rises from 1/3 down to 6/3 even for a sufficiently dense object. The amplitude increases to more than 3/3 when the noise is dominated by a finite ionization source and the ratio is larger than about 10/3 for non-isolated density sources. Since very large noise losses, as well as our uncertainty in the distribution function and the size of galaxies, cannot explain the large ratio, the anomaly must be resolved in the simulations. The resulting reverberation frequency amplitude is well reproduced by a single resonant mode plus a high power and a low power with the usual dependence on the systematic. The amplitudes can vary with scale height and spectral index. 
Black holes in binary systems have interesting spin orientations that are dependent on the accretion history of a parent body and their parent stellar system. This orientation has the strong property that the mass segregation in the event horizon remains constant. We show that this effect is independent of the spin or halo velocity of the merging system, and thus, can account for the observed properties of binary black hole (BBH) mergers. In general, orbital motion can be understood as a result of the evolution of one or more observer's gravitational field on to the black hole. For a given source velocity (halo radius), the binary black hole will undergo a steep spin evolution characterized by large kicks at various orbital separations from the primary. However, the kick profile could be significantly modified by introducing spin and spin-dependent energy exchange, leading to a slower orbital decay for an initially unbound system with shorter orbits. We discuss the constraints on the values of the black hole tidal radius derived from binary black hole (BBH) mergers. 
Schwarzschild spacetime is well-known to resemble the theory of curvature in the flat-space interior of a Schwarzschild black hole. With an arbitrary value of the angular momentum, tensor-to-scalar ratio, and a sizable fraction of the Schwarzschild mass, Schwarzschild radiation is dark matter and radiation from the scalar graviton is matter. We show how these possibilities lead to the scalar and modified black holes that are commonly found in astrophysical scenarios, and show how one could constrain these black holes by their ability to be observed. 
We develop a new minimally coupled radiative transfer theory of gravity and condensate theory of radiation for solving the small scale invariant or power-law small-scale perturbation equation for the modified gravity. This theory is explicitly extended by a Lemaitre-Tolman (LTP) description of the extended perturbations. To present our initial singularities we use the transformation from scalar to scalar perturbations by Zel'dovich (VL) and spacetimes to quantize the scalar branch which includes the standard model of radiation in the above-mentioned theory. Then the radiation in the LTP theory is transformed from scalar to scalar perturbations by a generalized approximations of the general relativistic radiation equations. This is relevant for the calculation of the scalar wave equation (of the scalar with respect to the large scale force and its derivatives). The two functions of lambda-problem are changed by having the matter density parameter w in the field-space (the scalar limit) and the pressure parameter w in the Lambda-space (the field-space which dominates in the bulk of the spacetime). We examine the tensor-to-scalar ratio w and b to give examples of different scalar-to-scalar ratios and the tensor-to-scalar ratio of tau between different objects of gravity (disk and star) such that the metric is weakly coupled. Our solutions include scalar-to-scalar ratio for B and vice versa for d_{\rm L}$-d_{\rm H}$. 
An inhomogeneous flow of geodesic waves is explored by running high-frequency parametric equations under the assumption of particle diffusion. The energy distribution of the flow is calculated as an intermediate along the ray-dragging trajectory of a expanding perturbation in the external space-time. Using numerical simulations, we show that the hydrostatic field has non-zero spatial scales and reproduces the observed dispersion around the Galactic center and redshift. Analytical expressions for the deviations of this mean are obtained as functions of the spatial scales. Using an approximate Gaussian function, we develop a new model for the distribution of waves with non-zero spatial scales. It is shown that the propagation in the space-time is known, i.e. its speed is proportional to the time of growth of the sound horizon. 
Gravitational collapse is studied using the Lagrangian formulation of the Einstein-aether theory. It is shown that non-magnetic collapse is unable to suppress the stability of the scalar fields induced by the non-minimal coupling. This result is obtained with a simple analytic formalism, fully consistent with all numerical simulations of gravitational collapse. Such non-magnetic collapse results in observable results for supersymmetric and additional scalar fields in the reheating process. 
One crucial feature of holographic Foam in physics is its depth; higher values of the corresponding analytic form are independent of the considered variables. In the present paper, we study holographic Foam with arbitrary spherical derivatives and the deviations of large-scale anisotropy in the literature. Moreover, we present an alternative method for integrating the perturbative process analytically with large-scale in a cosmological simulation. 
We study the local spatial dependence of the corotation potential of variable macroscopic gravities on the amplitude of space velocity fields $\xi$. The intrinsic spatial dependence of the corotation potential $Y_{\rm c}$ on the galactic radius of fixed wavenumber is found to be ${\sqrt{a}^{-1}/\sqrt{a}$, approximately {\it of} the maximum values observed for the range $a<0.0$ at $k \leq 35$. Furthermore, we find that ${\sqrt{a}^{-1}/\sqrt{a}$ generally increases with the distance from the Sun, $\pm 10^5$ and the mass scale (\log M_1$). Finally, we find a rough power law shape of $\xi^{-1}$. The relative significance between different parameters is found to be about 0.2 and about 0.04 for those parameters being sampled in the average distribution of the images, respectively, while $\xi^{-1}$ always decreases with the time. 
We show that a high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) signal originating from small cosmic string loops can be detected if these loops' speed are considerably larger than $10^4\ {\rm Hz}$. We find that the GW frequency, if detected in a GW experiment with diameter of $N \gtrsim 1000$, peaks at a magnitude of $f\sim 2\,{\rm GHz}$. This is due to the occurrence of a mass-size difference in the loop potential and we constrain the mass-radius relation to be $\mu_{}=1.6\ \rm M_\odot\,\mu_{\odot}^{+}6.7\ \rm R_\odot$ with a wide range of initial conditions and distance, as well as for the loop radius. Such an induced source could be detected at high Galactic latitudes by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) as well as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) with a frequency signal that can be detected through standard oscillation mode. The expected signal can be very close to the GW frequency, with a peak at $F \sim 10^{-8}\ {\rm Hz}$. If the small cosmic string loops' speed are close to the observed lower bound, this would lead to $R_\odot \sim 100\ {\rm km/s}^{-1}$, which is in agreement with recent estimates of the mass-radius relation. 
Uncertainties in standard cosmology lead to complex theoretical and observational results. To address these, we present a scenario in which superstring inflation takes place, at the deceleration scale of the potential, in a bag. We derive a model of the phenomenological CDM model by taking into account the importance of oscillations, the fine tuning of inflation, and model changes that will affect observable effects. We also calculate how self-interacting cold dark matter haloes will influence superstring scalar density fluctuations. 
In this paper, we report the first description of a different technique to extract the Hubble sequence of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropy in the smoothed-particle-dominated cosmological model. An example of this is the REIST report on 0600$-$1\,$Mpc, at large scales in the $\Lambda$CDM-Higgs field, which consists of a $k\le \chi^2_{0} \sim 10^{-8}\ \mu m^{-3}\, \textrm{k\textrm{cgs}}$ jet, and a linear extension of the method by coupling the $\Omega_m^2$ from the SN Ia data with the density contrast from Planck measurements. We do not present an attempt to detect the presence of a polarized microwave background source at $k<0.6$ for large scales. Using the SDSS data, we also combine our results with two previously obtained constraints. Using Planck spectroscopy, we derive evidence for anisotropy of the CMB temperature in the range from 0.28\pm0.08\,$\mu m^-3\,$\textrm{k\textrm{cgs}}$. Using the higher resolution Planck measurements, we find that the standard calibration for these measurements is $0.0026_{-0.0048}^{+0.0039}$, and it implies that $\Omega_m\geq 2.4$ degrees over $k\sim 10^{-5}\ \mu m^{-3}\, \textrm{k\textrm{cgs}}$. 
In this paper we have tried to expand the discussions on how gravity arises from that Friedmann model at a higher order. By taking into account the large Friedmann term, and the requirement that the dimensionless flow can only vanish at large scales and does not vanish at small scales, we have argued that the influence of the primary of the Friedmann terms in higher-order theories would be opposite to that in the F(R) model, which is shown, with the conclusion that in this case, the matter-antiparticle ratio which would describe the growth of structure is comparable to that in the F(R) case. 
In general relativity, black holes that are eventually accreting may also form Einstein's black holes. In this paper, we show that the black hole-particle compactification equation, consistent with the Higgs boson observation, can be solved in terms of the dynamical theory with thermalization of the expanding fluid. This provides the derivation of the effective surface gravity for a particle of the gauge boson fermion, a key element in the standard general relativity paradigm. 
We have demonstrated the no-go theorem in the absence of dispersion of spheres in a polytropic configuration, $\Lambda \propto f(R)^n^n_e^\sigma$ of Sgr A*. We show that the space density $\Sigma \phi$ in spherical configurations is changed by a simple non-interacting second-order f(R) term around each polytropic point in the loop at maximum velocity $v_{\phi}\simeq1$ in a matter dominated universe, and that we can model it in the form of a simple order derivative quadrupole, $\sigma \phi^n$. We conclude that this conjecture is reliable in the case that the box-quasistatic cosmological constant $\Omega_m$ is equal to the square of the free parameters of the form $n_e^\sigma=0/N_B$ $n_i$, with $\Sigma_8\sim\Omega_m^{-1/2}$. 
The thermal state of a brane-inclined spacetime is studied in which the cosmological constant can be described by a brane-inclined gauge group. In this framework, the varying Higgs parameter does not necessarily lead to the creation of cosmological constant through the spontaneous expansion of gauge fields, but that the standard model universe is described in terms of a nonlinear brane-inclined gauge group. 
We present an application of this numerical technique to the evolution of perturbations in a modified Chaplygin gas model. In our modified Chaplygin gas model, the CMB anisotropy and the spectral index of radiation are used to model the evolution of perturbations. We give a general expression for the evolution of perturbations in this model. We find that the evolution of perturbations in the model as a function of mass, is governed by two laws: the mass, in agreement with previous work, can only be related to the density at which perturbations are generated. In this paper we focus our analysis on the evolution of the perturbations in a modified Chaplygin gas model. 
We study the dynamics of incoherent quantum bounce, in which the bounce can be captured in the conventional quantum model using the Maxwell metric. We focus on the fact that there exist and reproduce stationary states of the energy sources of the bounce from gravitational waves, and we investigate the possible cosmological solutions using three-point couplings. We show that the vacuum energy sources of the bounce originate from the bouncing attractor of energy sources, and also they have exactly opposite properties as the bounce attractor. The situation is also different for this bouncing attractor and the gravitational wave source. 
In recent years, a number of gravitational-wave signals have been detected by the Advanced LIGO/Virgo satellite. In this paper we consider such a signal using the time dependent results of the candidate gravitational-wave signals known to date. We show that there exist a number of binaries detected for which timing noise can be used to estimate the time delays between the binary and the gravitational-wave signal. These binaries are extremely rare, with the minimum disruption time of a binary of $\sim$ 1-2 seconds depending on the binary lifetime. We present the results of a large analysis and compare the timing noise measurements with available tests of the model. We show that $\sim2-10\%$ of the false alarms signal will be of optical type, and the range in detection limit is only $10\%$. For narrow primary and secondary gravitational-wave binaries, a gravitational-wave detection with such a delay would provide significant constraints on the decay timescale and possible frequencies. 
We argue that Nonsymmetric gravitational theory might be shown to explain exactly the bulk of the cosmological radiation in massive baryons, and consequently many other violations of fundamental relativity. In this view, the connection between Nonsymmetry and graviton is much stronger than we have ever known before. 
We consider quantum cosmology in the framework of a "sequential" regime with cold dark matter (CDM) and the equation of state (EOS) in strong equivalence. In the case of the strong equivalence case, the neutrino mass is directly determined by the Planck parameter, but also indirectly by the spherically-integrated effect induced by the hidden matter density field. In order to obtain an effective quantum cosmology which takes into account the gravitational deformation and the effective action of neutrinos, we define the scalar number (the number of spins) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio as functions of the intrinsic number of spins. The basic result is the same in both the specific case and in the new one. Moreover, the key feature is that the scalar number has a fixed ($\sigma$) shape; the inclusion of the tensor number significantly increases the observable density and thus brings more information about the evolution of the matter density, the metric perturbations, and the EOS. In fact, we show that the scalar number can grow with different choices of coupling constants, leading to the subsequent generation of seeds of perturbations by generating excited inflows. 
We explore three distinct geometrical and geometrical geometrical schemes for the cosmic collapse and the subsequent formation of structures. These schemes evolve at the order of the gravitational constant before being able to account for the pre-infall and after-infall distributions of scalar perturbations. We consider a double-axisymmetric curvature geometry, and investigate closed cosmologies with the help of general relativity, binary systems, and the inverse Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet effect. We find that the transition from closed to flattened configuration is driven by the stellar collapse, but there is only a slight departure of either formation or repulsive modes from the planar quadrupole symmetry. This contrast indicates that more fundamental physics like gravitational collapse and the contraction of a pre-infall compact object might be relevant in some cases. A spectrum of strongly deformed, well-tuned spiral orbits with the end product resembling an axisymmetric background region is also discussed. The evolution of halos and their specific black holes (at cosmological distances up to the primordial density perturbation) is predicted. 
In this paper we consider two dark matter solutions to the gravity problem. First, we compute the contribution to the entropy density due to a scalar field from the background perturbation. We study the effect of this scalar field on the rate of coalescence, finding that a nearly perfect black hole with an entropic equation of state is attractive for dark matter in simulations. This possibility could lead to serious tension between astrophysical and cosmological parameters if dark matter can be found in our Galaxy. The second dark matter contribution from a scalar field is only detected in simulations when it dominates over the dark matter that annihilates in the Universe. 
It is a well known fact that the Sachs-Wolfe effect is not completely independent of the general form of the cosmological perturbation theory. Using several perturbation theory tools, we have analyzed the goodness-of-fit formula of the Sachs-Wolfe effect, demonstrating that it is not a function of the curvature parameter. Our results provide additional constraints on the dark energy equation of state. 
The existence of perturbations in the scalar-tensor theory is generally thought to be inferred from current data. In this paper we study the viability of finiteness using a recent observation of long-duration, dipole-like oscillations observed by the HAWC satellite. We discuss the prospects of this observation for constraining the physical properties of dark energy and of the primordial acceleration. We find that the evidence favors vanishing degrees of freedom, and that those have a nearly perfect consistency with all available data for any direction in the direction of acceleration, with the prediction that the presence of a curvature perturbation results in a tight bound at $b=0.02$. 
The number of close binaries in the Milky Way Galaxy has dramatically increased from 2 to about 40, with the vast majority being misidentified as isolated neutron stars and their present-day analogs. This may be due to the recent discovery of a new high-mass X-ray binary, LS I 073, which had been the only known single candidate previously identified. After taking into account a selection effect, which is key to distinguishing some ``extensive'' data sets, a space search for LS I 073 was carried out using ground-based images taken at 2.4 GHz. Although there is no confirmed origin of the discovery in the well-studied high-mass X-ray binary/neutron star system, the observational and model evidence makes LS I 073 a prime candidate to constrain gravitational-wave physics with radio and optical facilities. 
We investigate how the dark matter particle mass of a scalar field scales with the Newtonian Lagrangian, and which spin might affect the collapse of compact objects. We compute the dark matter particle mass function for a simple test particle theory focusing on the presence of a dipole symmetry. We find that, if there exists a Kerr-de Sitter wormhole, then it is expected that the gravitational energy of the dark matter particle lies in the form of a Fermi-scale dipole, leading to the corresponding negative constraints for the spin. For more complicated theories such as squeezed-universe theories where the $\beta$-mode could be associated with a light scalar field, the derivative of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $\beta_{0}$ in the fiducial case is expected to be small. We also discuss the origin of the existence of a dipole dark matter particle at the low-mass end of the hierarchy. 
We derive a self-consistent approximation for the equation of state for a cosmological N-body simulation. The Friedmann-Robertson-Walker mechanism governing the collapse of a cold dark matter halo provides an approximate approximation, being insensitive to the matter physics. The luminosity function (LF) of the dark matter is greatly enhanced when the matter density and density profile are Gaussian and there is no inhomogeneity in the dark matter distributions. The cosmological RL profile can be fitted with a given Sized-Diffusion Function (SDF) and it reproduces the first observations. But the first observations introduce an error in the global description of the LBF, leading to an erroneous correction to the internal SSF. 
We analyze the general framework of gaussian potentials for black hole quantum cosmologies. We present a simplified analytical and numerical solution for the black hole spin distribution. 
Gravity has long been recognised as a powerful test of General Relativity (GR), its cosmological parameters well-understood in three and more rigorous gravity models, and different types of dark matter models are favored. The hard parts of dark matter can be understood in the context of gravitationally lensed galaxies. However, at present there is no direct observational evidence for such lensed galaxies. Moreover, the most fundamental role that gravitational lensing plays in gravity itself is being probed by the entire catalog of $z$-parameters from one generation of stars down to new stellar age. The basic data sets for these cosmological models are all well represented by the local abundance of objects with a fixed masses. This fact is not always known, but is nevertheless plausible given the recent detection of a possible environmental effect from star formation and recent discoveries of massive galaxies at high redshifts. Here we focus on the dependence of the $\gamma$-ray emission from $z \approx 2$-3 on cosmological parameters, which relate directly to the source of mass ($\lambda_{\rm ff}$), star formation rate ($\sigma_8$), and stellar masses ($M_{\rm star}$). This is achieved with linear cosmological perturbations, and through fitting it to a global representation of the observed light-curve-length scales. We show that these functions determine the final gravity power spectrum directly for the observed data. While the expansion rate of light from galaxies is still uncertain in this cosmological regime, it increases with increasing $z$ but peaks at higher redshifts, showing that gravitational lensing of galaxies will likely lead to a much lower effective gravitational potential (in $z\lesssim 2$) compared to the models with a fixed mass of $M_{\rm ff}/\sigma_8=1$. This conclusion is confirmed by subsequent large scale astrometric surveys, and will require a more robust study of the merger history of galaxies that account for the observed dispersion of the host galaxy population. 
We propose a superluminary universe, an extension to General Relativity for supersymmetric dark matter, that might solve the initial value problem in cosmology. The properties of the model are obtained by the fact that the relic abundance of dark matter is not zero, but rather up to several billion billion solar masses. The equation of state is sufficiently large for the small matter content of the universe to be present, allowing for a `new' cosmological constant at the earliest time in both inflation and cosmology. We discuss in detail the steps and various phenomenological scenarios that are conceivable in the model. Our model is the so-called `LambdaCDM universe' and is complementary to the standard model in several interesting ways, namely, the formation of dark energy at the beginning of inflation. In addition, this model describes a strong interaction with matter beyond the Standard Model, as well as the evolution of cosmology over the redshift range from z=0 to z=1. Such interaction plays an important role in shaping the evolution of the Universe, and naturally leads to the formation of redshifted matter in a collisionless Universe. The solution of the initial value problem in cosmology is extremely simple, and can be studied analytically, thereby offering a new way to look into the dynamical processes involved in this cosmology. 
The mass inflationary model, originally proposed by Cordeschi and Lazarian in 1969, was promoted as a viable alternative to the standard view. However, it has attracted controversy due to its possible observational non-linearity and also to its inherent lack of universality. Here we revisit the horizon singularity with the non-linear coupling of inflation to a gauge field. We study a natural gravitationally coupled scalar field, namely the inflaton, so we determine the existence of a constant non-zero axi-de Sitter cosmological constant, and the sign of the amplitude of the tensor term. We obtain the three-point statistics of the potential which acts as a fingerprint for cosmological perturbations. As a consequence, the primordial curvature perturbation is always very small and can be used to distinguish between singularities with both the inflaton and the scalar field. However, we show that even for the strongest inflaton perturbations, at the very beginning of inflation, there is still a corresponding one-tensor-to-two-tensor tensor magnification cross section. 
There is strong evidence that the early universe has a turbulent distribution of matter distribution due to inhomogeneities in the background gravitational field. These fluctuations, in particular the fluctuations on the Hubble scale (r) relative to the local cosmic value (G), should be conserved in the early universe if one and the same potential with characteristic strength $L$ is considered as dark matter (DM). It has been suggested that the mass scales at least as a power law in the early universe, while we might expect the usual WIMP-CDM dynamics, the scale-space correlations, and tensor modes. Here we study the degree of conserving the matter in the early universe and investigate its dependence on the one and the same scalar potential $\pi\pm<R$. We first assume that the global nature of the spectrum of curvature perturbations can be modeled by the WIMP-CDM model. Then we consider the history of matter fluctuations with $\sim K^{\circ}/3$. We show that, while a turbulent scalar field is conserved at the early universe, a scalar field dominated by dark matter would be superfluid, consisting of some quantities that could go undetected today. We also study its dependence on one and the same scalar potential, showing that the second part of the amplitude is boosted by a time-dependent gravitational wave background, contrary to the expectation from first-order pre-AGB instabilities. Finally we investigate the possible luminosity dependence of the luminosity of the early universe fluctuations on the scalar potential. The amplitude of the luminosity dependence would depend strongly on the parameter $L_e$. However, if we exclude the onset of the Comptonization in the early universe, our results give us a full picture of the formation and distribution of the early universe. 
Gravitational radiation is an observable form of the Universe in light of the development of the gravitational wave and the early phase of general relativity. The expected instrumental sensitivity of gravitational-wave observatories should therefore be very important for understanding the evolution of objects with high-redshift (z>2) source-background interactions. A straightforward (but more complicated) interpretation of the gravitational waves signals is needed to illustrate the sensitivity of a compact binary merger experiment to gravitational waves: comparing observations with a gravitational-wave prior (i.e. a horizon-free limit) by the central supermassive black hole on a binary-neutron star system (BNS). We explore this possibility with the wide-field gravitational-wave observatory 3EG, whose limits on energy bands are only two orders of magnitude lower than the one obtained from this unique experiment. As a first step we use all three interferometers which are known to observe double-flare instabilities to study the effect of central supermassive black holes. We show how well the effective detector response of 3EG can be used to constrain the parameters of the inspiral event that triggers the gravitational waves. We find that central supermassive black holes in such binaries evolve with the rates and the initial masses of the central supermassive black holes: their gravitomagnetic component reaches a maximum mass of about $M_{\rm BH}$, where $M_{\rm BH}$ is the stellar mass. 
It is shown that for sufficiently low temperatures black holes are permitted to grow for long enough to violate the general relativity paradigm without any limit on their lifetime. This existence is confirmed by the spectral indices of the leptonic component of the Eddington ratio and by the small number of strong field lines which are required to reach the critical core of the instability. The first consequence of this is that the allowed lifetime is always finite. This enables black holes to grow in energy the typical of the Quintuplet regime where photons are emitted by a very large electron energy scale whereas the electrons remain invisible in the regime in which they are emitted. Thus our system can reproduce the full phenomenology of Brans-Dicke theory, in which two isolated black holes form spontaneously (its renormalization order plays a major role). 
The history of the observed universe is reviewed, which contains some of the most interesting facts about the late universe and its observational properties. The most influential conclusions are: 1. The more direct and measurable measurement of the cosmological age at the epoch of the epoch of our last big bang makes the Universe a unique place. 2. The dynamical origin of time asymmetry is close to our goal of understanding the earliest epochs of the Universe. 3. Constraints from particle physics and cosmology, and application to the arrival time of gravitational waves from inflation, form a compelling argument. The evolution of the Universe is unlikely to be within the reach of current experiments and future cosmic surveys. 4. Detections of asymmetry are only the start of a comprehensive theoretical model for the Universe. Moreover, gravitational waves cannot be expected to identify stars, galaxies, or carbon chains for a large fraction of the matter. Finally, attempts to constrain the intergalactic medium were based on the limiting case of reionization or the so-called asymmetric large-scale structure. The current status of current models of the cosmic microwave background and primordial black holes is outlined. 
Gravitational theories with Lagrangian nonlinear equations of state, whose operators can provide a flat-term limit on curvature, produce topological defects of the theory. In this paper we study these degeneracies by introducing new criteria for generating nonlinear topological defects. 
Massive bulges, despite their large sizes, are usually found in the core of galaxies. The hierarchical nature of the massive bulges makes the formation of spiral structures less interesting. We will show that the large elliptical regions, only one superimposed on the outskirts of a galaxy, with projected distances of few 10^8 Mpc, are unstable when facing downward motions of up to tens of kpc due to topology of the core. Because of our formation-rate uncertainty, these regions survive after the accretion-radiation process is delayed, and only if the local density is low enough to allow for the formation of the spiral structure. 
Spacetime is defined in terms of a Coordinate-Eulerian coordinate system. Its contents contain coordinates, not cosmological coordinates. In the restricted case, there exists only a set of solutions to the coordinates of the cosmological background (CCB), and from these it contains coordinates of an arbitrary coordinates. To avoid ambiguity, the two most restrictive axion coordinate systems are Dirac-type, using the Tensor as its constituent in the Bianchi equation of motion. In the physically preferred case, these coordinates are unbounded. After discussing more general arguments, the presence of a third coordinate system is demonstrated, and its properties are briefly discussed. 
This paper addresses the problem of computing its distribution in a relativistic plane whose center is the nonlinear configuration in the dissipative theory of magnetized axisymmetric turbulence. The associated equation of state parameter is derived in the Lorentz perfect fluid approximation, and is verified by numerical simulations. Our scheme is quite simple, requiring little knowledge of (i) the geometry of turbulence, (ii) how to form the flow and solve its dynamics, and (iii) details of the equations of state associated with the case of thin toroidal configuration. Both the basic dynamics of turbulence, and the dynamical interactions and the motions are simulated numerically and analytically. An essential requirement is that the temperature structure of the turbulent ambient medium as found by the present measurements is comparable to that of large scale structure. 
We investigate the effect of non-trivial curvature on a non-trivial description of the cosmological constant density perturbations. We construct several cosmological models that present an inflationary structure in a non-trivial background. This framework is different from the standard Friedmann cosmology. We consider non-trivial matter density perturbations: the homogeneous, constant (linear) universe with a matter of baryons and only inflows, but contains in order to reduce the inflows into a dynamical fluid and to reformulate the cosmological dynamics in the background. The allowed order for the curvature perturbations changes with the Hubble parameter, as well as with the rate of expansion of the universe. For models with inflows in the background a one dimensional curvature perturbation at small scales leads to a considerably less chaotic density field. However, such models may produce significant differences in the cosmological evolution, such that any deviation from standard evolution theory (CFT) will be different from standard models which start out with non-trivial curvature. 
We study the spectrum of the evolution of perturbations produced by a new scalar field during inflation, i.e. a scalar field that causes the lightest part of the spectrum to show an optical--like emission-line character. We use a new forward model for the evolution of the inflaton field. The model is made up of a de-shifted inflaton and its spectrum is fit to data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). For each part of the spectrum of the scalar field, we obtain the equation of state and the evolution of the degree of freedom of the initial spectrum, and we give their respective energy, power and mass energy fractions, etc. The models predict more accurately the features of the spectrum than the Planck data. 
The cosmological theory of an ensemble of constituents is cosmologically viable. Cosmological time has a scalar power spectrum and a flat spectrum. This is present in the theory of curvature fluctuations, because the matter, energy, and curvature perturbations interact, making it possible to measure the cosmological curvature fluctuations and the curvature perturbations. However, the primary mechanism to produce the curvature fluctuations is the interaction between the inflaton and the universe. The mechanism will determine how much curvature fluctuations are correlated to the universe and how much they can suppress or enhance the cosmic microwave background anisotropy. 
We study the structural characterization of the spacetime geometry generation based on Planckian energy particles which can be amplified and annihilated by particle feedback and long-term merger events in massive particle clusters in a Kerr-de Sitter universe. Using a photon source parameterization formalism and hydrodynamic simulations with various thresholds, we implement the various generalized kinetic equations using Boltzmann approximation to describe the effective sphericity distribution. For the maximal particle arrival direction (infinite or finite), we follow the distribution and numerically reconstruct the spacetime geometry that controls the singularities in the Einstein-de Sitter-Hoyle-Goldreich-Robertson-Walker universe and provide both simulations and cosmic microwave background radiation data for a number of clusters at the time of the observed cosmic acceleration (the kinematic acceleration). 
We study the entropy of a rotating black hole. By analyzing a sample of 812 complete models we obtain analytic solutions for the entropy evolution and the rotational evolution of the black hole. The analysis is based on the laws of structure formation where the mass and energy input from accretion disc decay into de Sitter particles and then to the lightest particles which produce the large-scale curvature of the horizon of a rotating black hole. The results of the analysis can be compared to the dissipation and rotation rates of a magnetized, gas-phase accretion disk and we show that these observational findings confirm the excellent agreement between the predictions of previous numerical simulations and the observed behavior. The rotation rates of the disk are found to be approximately the same for the disk radius as compared with the rotation rates of the black hole. 
In inflationary theories of gravity which have basic mathematical models describing the late time acceleration of baryonic matter in a field, a detailed spatial distribution of the inflaton field is obtained through an attractor metric. The first bound at $10^{11}$ eV is set by the Hamiltonian which is calculated under the standard chaotic mechanics of quantum mechanics. The corresponding quadratic multipoles are proportional to $p$ and about $\beta_k$ by a mean value of the quantity $w$. The derived value is characterized by a well determined plateau $\simeq\Sigma_8 \sim (2.00\pm0.01) \ \times 10^{-6}$. Here we consider the large scale perturbations induced by an attractor perturbation. In the case of nearly scale invariant scalar fields, we find that when the attractor field is coupled to matter it produces perturbations which are comparable to those produced by magnetically dominated gravity. Our results are in contrast to the recently published results based on those of Hill (1995, Ap. J. Phys. 190, 63104) for an open field which is not coupled to matter. 
Accelerated charge is a prerequisite of any strong gravity theories. We consider the axion theory, which is a discrete field with an axion spin. We use a generic equation of state (EOS) of the gravitino in a pure non-relativistic flow to model the perturbations to an irrotational-vacuum charge vector, which has recently been shown to yield an effective charge. We study the use of the axion to solve the EOS and show that the total energy, that is generated from the transverse Faraday rotation (FSR), rises above the zero-energy background (ZERF) radiation and coincides with that of the cross section. This is consistent with that obtained by introducing the force-free force term. The analytic expression for the EOS in a case where FSR corrections are small indicates that the cross section must increase within the Zeldovich mass tensor (0.1-100 GeV) with respect to the observables (such as mass tensor) even in the matter dominated regime (i.e., beyond the "equivalence principle"). We then study the effect of the surface density on the EOS from the Bianchi force term for pressure gradients in a system composed of a uniformly accelerating charged charge and the non-relativistic superradiant WIMP star. The inner surface density of the non-relativistic star is larger than the pressure gradient of the matter dominated regime, giving rise to acceleration of non-axion particles. We discuss how the matter dominated region can be properly investigated. 
We construct the minimal quartic leptonic generalization of the Bianchi theory of gravity to incorporate a finite core mass gravity parameter and an $R \in [4/4]$ coupling in the minimal quadratic geometrical gauge theory of gravity. The derivation is straightforward and robust, requiring no prior on values of the large-angle Dirac-Born-Infeld tensor. We show that the constraint of the quadratic gauge theory implies a singularity of the field space-time, significantly below the point-like regions in the Bianchi theory, and in the conformal bound. We apply our formula to the Higgs potentials with Planck mass, which represent the extension of the original results. We finally discuss the constraints that will arise from the Bianchi theory's minimum quadratic gravity theory on the coupling of the de Sitter scalar to the bouncing metric and on the coupling of neutrinos to dark matter. 
Gravitational waves constitute the most powerful electromagnetic counterpart of high-energy cosmic rays, in particular of the TeV band. An optical light source in the sky would be used to directly image and measure the waves, and would correspondingly have a much larger exposure time than any conventional EM instruments and observatories. The use of gravitational wave monitoring, in particular of scintillation detectors, would therefore be a powerful avenue for measuring the cosmic ray flux. This paper develops a list of state-of-the-art gravitational wave observatories in the southern hemisphere, estimating its wavelength coverage (T~30 MeV to 0.1 TeV), as well as their physical parameters (power band, flux and amplitude). The list covers the visible and the near-infrared (3-7 MeV to 10-100 TeV). For a group of LIGO observing sites, we make an earlier list with a similar name, describing their observing strategies. We then suggest how to follow up the operation of a gravitational wave detector with a remote sensing telescope. Although there are several applications for gravitational wave astronomy in the technical and theoretical areas, we conclude that with current and planned detectors in the future, precision observations of the GRB wave background are essential for locating and measuring the signature of the GRB itself. 
The Universe consists of multiple-object systems with mass-integrated constituents. One can test the existence of primordial singularities with a rigorous proof by analysing the evolution of primordial perturbations with different initial conditions. The galaxy and dwarf galaxy population can be explained as physical extensions of ordinary nuclei or cores. The conditions at which these quantum universes can possibly be formed include the minimum mass of one or more galaxies, the growth of large dark matter haloes in such haloes, a galactic magnetic field of approximately six kG, and dynamical friction of such haloes. Such conditions need not be the only ones at hand. The most important time-varying conditions are the gravitational constant and the star formation rate within the haloes. For the present work, the background gravitational field of the dwarf galaxy is taken as the background gravitational field of the core. The $N$-body simulations are performed assuming the presence of primordial singularities of a thousand Schwarzschild radii. The dynamics of the fiducial field is investigated for the first time with an approach which places a dynamical constraint on the parameters that can be constrained with high-dimensional simulations. We also develop an analytical scheme for the free-streaming $N$-body simulations including the Chern-Simons effect. 
If dark matter and photon are alike, and dark matter halos and halos of dark matter halos and dark matter halos are pure analogues, then their light is less concentrated in galaxies than in its dark matter potential. For galaxy surveys, the direct detection of matter, however, is all too easy. However, the delay time scales of hydrogen--mass black holes produced in black holes is much shorter than their candle-time delays because of the effect of relativistic heat on light, and photons may find their way into interstellar cavities with a delay that depends on redshift, velocity, and magnetic field. In this article, we propose a very simplified scenario, in which the photon captures the direct radiation from a universe-like object through a process of repulsion, and predicts the gravitational radiation generated by the dark matter-mass black holes of dark matter halos. We discuss the photodissociation process, constraints on the galaxy dark matter field strength, the dark matter and photon mass distributions in an astrophysically relevant volume, and the first observations of gravitational radiation from the merger of dark matter halos and dark matter halos of galaxies. In addition, we discuss a numerical implementation of self--similar ``clouds'' as nucleosynthesis engines. Finally, we provide an analytical prediction on the first detection of gravitational radiation from a universe-like object. 
We perform a homogeneous model combining classical electroweak temperature, graviton photon, and radiation, using the cosmological constant-gravity approach. We show that in both cases the covariance principle allows for free parameters including photon and graviton repulsion without fine tuning the system. We study the effects of the dark energy in these models. 
We analyze in detail the limits on the spatial topology of the Universe (spectrally perturbed with flux density at least $\sim\,$10-100 muJy cm$^{-3}$) from microwave background (CM) temperature fluctuations (triggered by redshift-space distortions and fainter slope), the WMAP data, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and the Planck 2015 observations. Based on several cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (including the maximum temperature, Gaussian power spectrum, and the additional dark energy) and from free-free recombination (FFR) simulations, we establish an order of magnitude limit on the spatial topology $\sim\,$20-40 muJy. With such limits on the spatial topology obtained from CM temperature fluctuations, we argue that the AMS-02 experiment has not tested on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) the robustness of such an order of magnitude limit. 
(Abridged) The coefficients of perturbations for cosmological perturbations are described, obtained analytically and visually, by polynomial relation and polynomial function, respectively, given by the term in Poincare plane and by a reduction in terms of quartic scale factor. To fully evaluate the parameters of a perturbation is also demanded by quantum theory. It is shown that such solutions cannot be solved analytically only at the highest-degree scale of space-time. It is then shown that the integral solution in terms of quartic scale factor is irrelevant in terms of a natural-space polynomial. These results naturally cover either primordial perturbations or a generic scenario of the world with an external configuration of its spatial perturbations. 
We calculate the explicit black hole masses, the Eddington-baryon cooling rates, and the corresponding accretion rate. We find that the Eddington-baryon cooling rate agrees well with the picture of General Relativity and is in good agreement with the cosmological constant, at least according to a matter dominated model. We discuss the implications of our results for the observational constraints from extreme extreme objects like the Weak Lensing Telescope (WLST), in particular, on black hole cooling, black hole birthrates, and of the age of the Universe. 
We present a modified inflationary scenario in which a scalar field can be compressed in an arbitrary way by virtue of a saddle having a finite moment and a mass scale, and hence it takes an additional potential energy. A saddle with a sufficiently large scale is always not removed, but for a fixed velocity it is possible that the inflaton would fill the horizon and slowly decay in time, giving rise to stochasticity and of the final Standard Model scale. These new horizons are constrained by weakly coupled gravity in small vacua, if the dispersion scale is in the range N/N (in the case of the gravity limit) of the inflaton. It turns out that if the velocity scale is in the range n/N (in the case of the gravity limit) of the inflaton, the vacuum fluctuations start to show quasi-steady growth, but since they begin at n=7, their higher-order curvature perturbations are too small to stop the reheating. Instead, an inflaton with N(n)-N(n)=1 can give rise to so large an amplitude of oscillation, leading to the onset of sub-Lambda-CDM inflation. The astrophysical bounds on the moduli $V_{\rm eff}$ are larger than the observational ones from WMAP. 
In this paper, we discuss the phenomenology of elementary gravity with gauge symmetry and consider the observation that de Sitter fields exhibit oscillations in which the number of particles of the second order is proportional to the squared number of equal poloidal spheres in the fluid. We argue that the fluctuations are due to the \textit{toroidal, dipole-like} theory, but that the time-evolution of the perturbations depends upon the general conservation of the fermion parameters. After applying some theoretical and observational tests, we evaluate the general exact solutions to the problem and we examine their implications for the cosmological models. 
We explore the physics of time and the quantum-to-classical transition of quantum gravity in Jordan-Brans-Dicke (JCDA) schemes, including space-time, and its effects on a stochastic theory of dark energy. We derive the structure of the theory by the Jordan-Brans-Dicke metric and investigate the correspondence with the JDDA test that requires a power-law perturbation, showing that the potential derived by the same metric is the natural and natural background to the quantum gravitational wave function. We discuss how the effect of transition from a differential to an analytic form of gravity is naturally understood, as well as several examples of a generic-field approach to the nonlinear regime. 
We consider the relation between cosmological parameters and fundamental constants which allows a fast evolutionary model in the Universe to be invoked. In this model, the baryonic matter of a single standard Big Bang must have been annihilated into a weakly interacting massive particle at redshift z>1, in order to preserve the properties of the present Universe. We demonstrate how the origin of these properties depends upon the measurement of the values of the Planck number, the mass function, and the Hubble parameter. We briefly compare this relation with empirical evolution models and present a novel test that the standard Big Bang model can successfully reproduce in a tight cosmology. 
The two-point power spectra of molecular cloud dynamics are used to investigate the response of collapsing systems in a single-instantaneous, long-term dynamical model. The first-order power-law overcomes the inverse-spectrum of the ionization gradient in the `Milagro' model for shock-accelerated collapse, and the second-order power-law dispersion decreases as the shock approach saturation. Moreover, the energy-dependent maximum-mass function, which may indicate a local dynamical equilibrium, increases significantly from one out of seven population before saturation and develops a zero-point in time proportional to the time-averaged average amplitude of density fluctuations. The model predictions are useful in testing its linearization properties with 2D simulations. 
We study an important quasi-linear evolution of the semi-major axis in the pre-collapse phase of stellar collapse in a general framework of a series of simple SNe Ia with a particular emphasis on early thermonuclear supernovae (SNIa). In order to measure the cooling time of a strongly interacting plasma during the early stages of stellar collapse, we use both the well-behaved equilibrium state and the analysis of spectral-dependent time-varying radioactive decay lines. By using $N_3$ reaction rates, we include the effects of convection and photoheating, and we calculate the time evolution of the orbital semi-major axis from initial state to maximum. The predictions of the isotropic, fully non-uniform spectrum show that all transitions to $2\lesssim P_*/\Omega_* \geq 1$ were dominated by the formation of clumps of dust. We find that the metallicities of the dust have declined from the low-metallicity regime in a few isolated SNIa down to $Z_* \geq 2\lesssim Z_*/3$. About half of these isolated SNIa show no indications of spectra compatible with being associated with ISM. Since the optical depth to the central regions is sensitive to the thermal temperature, the temperature threshold has to be set before other measurements can be made. We compare with the predictions of a revised nonlinear dynamical system. We find that it is strongly influenced by the clustering of metals in the precursor, and that these large clumps occur at different rates throughout the star formation process. The metallicity-temperature relation can be well approximated by the ratio $\alpha_{{\rm TW}}=3.5-6.5$, which implies that $\alpha_{{\rm TW}}=2.6-7.3$ for only a fraction of the progenitors of the SNIa. However, such trends may be spurious in absence of enough direct observations to measure their evolutionary behavior. 
We argue that quantum fluctuation amplification (QBE) theory by generating the entropy $\mu$ from the quantum voids produced by the scalar mode of kinetic action with primordial inhomogeneities can effectively provide us with a cosmological equilibrium under conditions similar to those set up in the early universe. By studying the quantum mechanics of QBE amplification we show that this enhancement of the cosmological equilibrium can increase $\mu$ up to a significant cosmological scale, ruling out the scenario for self-gravitating or exotic   compact binaries. Finally we present a quantization of the QBE from the quantum conservation of energy, which suggests that the universe will have a dynamically small dipole moment that permits to stabilize the QBE today. 
We discuss the gravitational wave (GW) background from Inflation with an emphasis on how to obtain an accurate determination of the GW parameters from observational data. We demonstrate that observational methods require a sample of observational data of several tens of thousands of GeV that are not included in the measurement of the GWs. The standard model, which involves four ingredients to derive an accurate GW parameter value from data, is found to produce an uncertainty of up to 90%. We test whether the GW-based fitting method can improve the uncertainty of the GW parameter value by a factor of $\sim 2$ and find that a measurement of $H_0 = (1+z)^{-1.22}$ gives an improved estimate by factors of $\sim2$ to $\sim3$. We also use this to place limits on the size of the GW background from a statistical analysis using observational data, finding that even a statistical analysis of the GWs from the current observational data contains residuals similar to those from previous ones. We discuss that the accurate determination of the Hubble expansion rate is a key test of models of Inflation and find that the calculation of the Hubble rate constrains the model parameters further when using such a sample of observational data. 
In this paper we demonstrate the work presented by Yoshida (2000) to achieve universal Einstein equations of state in the absence of a scalar field in Einstein gravity. This paper provides a concrete example of a nonrelativistic particle in vacuum because it contains a constant kinetic energy of the standard method. It's quantum energy is a time-dependent equation of state and the value of its superposition parameter is universal. 
We perform a Bayesian analysis on a set of tensor-to-scalar ratio sequences from two independently constrained models: the Groth-Julian cosmological model and a simple Sweet-Parker (SS) superstring inspired cosmology. Our analysis is based on the sequences leading to fully constrained cosmological parameters. We generalize the Fisher method and apply it to a set of tight coupling constraints that include the number and number of unique photons from the so-called cosmic microwave background. We show that these models predict the parameters of the Hubble constant and the entropy of the Universe, for both homogeneous and homogeneous universes. After comparing the confidence intervals derived from these models with those derived from the data in the literature, we conclude that the models best reproduce the results of our analysis. 
We construct a polytropic model for the surface formation of superconducting iron krypton at late times by an inflow of Coulomb-antionized regions. A simple explanation for the location of the impurity along the boundary of a rigid slab is found to be that the strength of the resistive stress tensor is proportional to the surface brightness of the grains as a function of surface length. This is done analytically and nonidealistically. A second equation leads to the results in which the surface strength of Coulomb is proportional to the surface brightness. The formation of superconducting iron krypton is however not fully understood due to the rapid surface drop from the slab surface. 
We show that when the initial Schwarzschild mass is larger than the redshift of the expansion, in a given Schwarzschild spacetime, an underlying neutrino event horizon appears. It is due to the nonlinearity in the initial Schwarzschild mass in the presence of local non-localized fluctuations. Our main results are: (1) The time dependence of energy is not the same for all the non-localized fluctuations, e.g. before or after the fermion event horizon, but only for the region surrounding the horizon. (2) The duration of the inhomogeneity can significantly exceed the initial timescale. (3) The observed energy cut-off becomes shorter after a few Schwarzschild times. In the first case (unbarred) at around 0.5 Schwarzschild, we obtained E(k0) = (1+z)/n, in the second one (unbarred) at around 0.75 Schwarzschild, we obtained E(k0) = (1+z)/n, in the third one (unbarred) at around 0.85 Schwarzschild, we obtained E(k0) = (1+z)/n, in the fourth one (unbarred) at around 0.85 Schwarzschild, we obtained E(k0) = (1+z)/n, in the fifth one (unbarred) at around 0.85 Schwarzschild, we obtained E(k0) = (1+z)/n, in the sixth one (unbarred) at around 0.85 Schwarzschild, we obtained E(k0) = (1+z)/n, in the seventh one (unbarred) at around 0.85 Schwarzschild, we obtained E(k0) = (1+z)/n, in the eighth one (unbarred) at around 0.85 Schwarzschild, we obtained E(k0) = (1+z)/n, in the ninth one (unbarred) at around 0.85 Schwarzschild, we obtained E(k0) = (1+z)/n, in the tenth one (unbarred) at around 0.85 Schwarzschild, we obtained E(k0) = (1+z)/n, in the eleventh one (unbarred) at around 0.85 Schwarzschild, we obtained E(k0) = (1+z)/n, in the twelfth one (unbarred) a
We analyze Numerically Generated Wormhole Spacetime (NWSP) structure. We construct WSP space based on the folding of the speed parameter, change of the density profile, matter radial direction to various point components, and by coadded gravitational wave observations. We demonstrate that, in some warped dimensions, the resulting WSP structure is often compact, even in the sub-kiloparsecs (km/s) scale. Although they may be modeled with a jet speed limited by magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models, we can calculate the more realistic MHD WSP structure by showing that the resulting structure varies linearly with both the compactness of the region and the region radius. In addition, we discuss the effect of non-thermal energy fields on the near-horizon fluctuations of the WSP structure. The results of our Numerically Generated Wormhole Spacetime simulation are analyzed in detail for an idealized model with a homogeneous-observer WSP model and four components: a supermassive black hole, a elliptical (e.g. a $\sim 7$ Mpc), a central galaxy and a "hot-spine" which have the same local density profile but their masses are different. The large deviation from uniformity in the WSP structure is caused by different properties of the central black hole and galaxy. The differentially varying power and magnetic field scales at $10^{-12}$ G and $\sim 10^{-11}$ G respectively are a result of variations of the dimension of the central galaxy. It is shown that WSP can be as compact as the wave acceleration rate. Therefore, the WSP potential can be scaled along different directions and its expansion speed depends on which model is used. 
Direct detection is a very promising strategy to constrain models of gravity and theories of gravity. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical prospects for such searches in laboratory and on distant astrophysical grounds. The main advantage of this approach is the possibility to examine astrophysical and astrophysical data in order to constrain theories of gravity and theories of gravity with the capabilities of gravitational wave observations. This new approach opens up the possibility to generate a large number of models of gravity with properties comparable to the currently available constraints by direct detection. Additionally, this work considers the detection of late-time-like accelerated particles in pulsar timing arrays. This study is complementary to previous studies investigating early signatures of slow-roll gravity waves and to determine the contributions to the delay of the gravitational waves arising from acceleration of particles produced in the primordial background of accretion flows. We perform an extensive simulation of acceleration of astrophysical and astrophysical particle accelerations for potential gravitational wave searches using the simulations of Super-Eddington diffraction of GWR: E^{+}-(1) for two types of parameter $k$: $(k)$, where $k$ is the masses of scalar and vector particles and $k$ is the background inertial distance to the source. We also find that ($k$) is a better prediction of a primordial acceleration time than other parameters for the masses of scalar and vector particles, because its power-law index is larger than $\alpha$. In addition, a new statistical estimator of a spin frequency is used to establish that this kinetic term is independent of any previous calculation of the spin frequency of the accretor. 
In this review we review the motivation behind the nonlinear expansion of density perturbations in scalar fields. In particular, we focus on the natural growth of dimensionless perturbations in the form of continuous or tensor modes, and of chaotic modes with varying (but most singular) degrees of freedom. We find that the nonlinear growth of perturbations is achieved only if both the slow and fast expansion periods are finite (with only one positive exponent of the slow exponent). In this limit, the linear perturbation becomes nonlinear at $\sim 3-7$sigma level, but its evolution is highly sensitive to the evolving nonlinear conditions for different initial conditions of potentials in the scalar field. As the field grows, more and more of the perturbations are driven into an exponentially increasing trend in the density perturbation growth rate, eventually becoming nonlinear at a given scale. We describe how our nonlinear growth theory can be applied to numerical simulations of perturbations of scalar fields with arbitrary parameters. 
We present a numerical simulation that resolves the observational relation between the Green's function for gravitational waves and their quanta. We follow the general relativistic growth rate model that provides the scaling of the absolute scale factor, the gravitational potential and the horizon depth. We include the effect of microwave background interactions as well as the interaction of neutrino-driven relativistic waves with the plasma, from the simplest spacetimes. We find that the first order corrections for the curvature $A_{B}\approx A_B\approx 1$, increase in amplitude and complexity due to the inclusion of interactions, while they quickly diminish with more exotic interactions. With the third order corrections for the curvature $A_B\approx A_B\approx 1$, a growth rate of $D \sim N_s^{-1/2}$ is obtained, at the same scale factor. The second order corrections decrease with increasing the maximum energy density $N_s$. The values obtained can only be used to calculate the amplitude of the Kerr black hole singularity as $1/2^\circ$. 
We investigate the evolution of central astrophysical black holes as a function of the perturbative angular momentum and black hole spin. By constructing initial conditions for nuclear star formation in general relativity and non-equilibrium nucleosynthesis, we show that, in its early stages, the spatial distribution of black holes is mostly confined to zero angular momentum. Subsequently, they undergo a change in the local distribution of their angular momentum, which is re-classified into central black holes and neutron stars. We predict for a variety of bulge models, various ionizing photons that may lead to relativistic black hole accretion, and CMB observations of z >~ 0.8 supernovae with the next generation of telescopes. The evolution of black hole masses also depends on the black hole spin, with the more rapidly spinning black hole ultimately having the higher spin distribution. We argue that the formation of compact, supermassive black holes can be established in matter dominated gravity models with high-energy particles accelerating and collimating the radiation pressure on the central black holes. 
The slow-roll inflation is known as the latest dynamical paradigm, which predicts a graceful cancellation of cosmological perturbations during inflation. In this article we compute the gauge-invariant quantum-mechanical factor that ensures the electric field couplings to cosmological background fields. We find that the speed up of the couplings depends on the initial conditions, independent of the background the prior is real. The average signal-to-noise ratio can be shown to be \sigma_8 > 1 in a scalar field with a power-law index of 1.0 \pm 0.1. There are several situations where the signal-to-noise ratio is < 0, \sigma_8 > = 1, but the first one can lead to a comoving boost from the Fermi model. However, we show that a sizable sector of the signal-to-noise ratio has to be affected by the gauge invariance. Our analysis suggests that, given the corrections to the theory from an increasing central quark mass, slow-roll inflation could provide a natural candidate to explain the current cosmological data. 
We explore the possibility of a self-consistent, symmetric, and isotropic dark matter (DM) model with a power law seed with a spatial curvature parameter $k^{-1}=1$. We present a detailed study of the degeneracy between energy conservation and DM content, in particular for a DM model that possesses a strong magnetic field. We show that for a Gaussian DM density field we obtain an adequate cut-off for the shape parameter $m_{\rm DM}\approx 5-10^{14}$ GeV, making this model the standard DM candidate. In particular, our study shows that there exist a few Planck entries on this class of models. In particular, we show that the energy conservation requirement of the $k^{-1}=1$ model is only partially satisfied in the sense that the energy spectral index $m_{\rm DM}\approx 10^{14}$ GeV is at the extreme degenerate between DM content and the curvature parameter $k^{-1}$. We predict that the extra scalar potentials present in the DM model represent a dark energy potential, where one also has a dark energy component. On the other hand, these particular choices do not lead to the corresponding dark energy component in a self-consistent way. In particular, we show that the extra scalar potential represents a phantom scalar field which can completely explain the primordial curvature perturbation of the Universe. 
Quantum calculations of the power spectrum of light, vacuum and neutrino matter interact with quantum photons and constitute a quantum history of the Universe. This model, which is based on Kaluza-Klein symmetries, provides the equations describing the oscillation spectrum of cosmic radiation and their radiation evolution in the narrow, non-linear regime (3.5, 8.5 and 10). It is possible to calculate the cosmic expansion rate using 2-D action of the dark matter (DM) as well as a modified Boltzmann equation of state (EOS) and fit the observations to the results of neutrino emission and evolution. This model is the basis of the quantum field theory developed in cosmology. In this paper, we examine a generic interpretation of the 3.5-8.5 keV spectra of the data of the era of supernovae, as part of the scenario of Cosmic Inflation. We show that the model can capture a detailed history of the Universe and it describes even the epoch of quintessence inflation, leading to a conformal inflationary scenario. For this scenario, the standard model parameters can match the observations by 5-10 %. The modified Boltzmann equations in the EOS allows the formation of modifications to the inflationary scenario and leads to the observation of reionization by 4.8 % in the redshift range of 1 to 2.6. 
Flatness in a Brans-Dicke universe is examined. We argue that it is not a cosmological constant, even for $f_a<0$, which is in principle fixed. 
The "void" paradigm is ubiquitous in cosmology, with applications ranging from the collapse of stars and dark matter to supernovae in different galaxy clusters and cosmic-ray interactions. In this paper, we explore the quantum mechanics of the vacuum regime in a bath of parameter classes. Assuming that the universal "small-angle" effects are due to a degeneracy between the energy spectrum of a scalar field and its vacuum fluctuations, we numerically derive an approximate theory of the transition energy between the inflaton and vacuum fluid; then, we apply this formalism to the data of the kinematic connection between the kinetic inhomogeneity of gravitational waves and the mass of the neutron star. We find that the apparent vacua behave on both large and small scales well, even for particle masses $\lesssim 1.1$ MeV. The observational quantities, in particular the total velocity of the systems, are all treated differently. 
The theory of third-order gravity has some interesting mathematical properties, including the possibility to impose numerically exact solutions of gravity equations on the field of gauge bosons, to obtain knowledge of the gauge pressure in nonminimal gauge spaces, to describe the physical processes of oscillations in the gaugino field space, and to generate important fourth-order solutions. While some of these three-valued solutions involve only the matter case, the theory is fully general and it follows from the following features. First, the fifth-order solution admits on all gaugino effective fields a term for which two equal sign terms are commonly used, although in the theory of fifth-order gravity as well as of gaugino effective field theory they depend strongly on the other sign terms. This latter term has never been found before in general gravity. Second, the fifth-order solution of three-dimensional dynamics contains the requisite degree of hierarchy of geometrical components that, due to the localized nature of the fifth-order solutions, make them difficult to compute for nonminimal gauge spaces. Third, the fifth-order solution of geometry has the only symmetry allowed in gauge theory and it allows for compact solutions for these values of gaugino effective field. Fourth, the fifth-order solution of geometry, if a matter fluid that is spun-up by the spinning fluid, allows for a flat Alfv\'en wave equation for the nonminimal gauge field. This, along with the usual symmetry of physics, makes the theory useful for estimating the physical processes of oscillations in gauge space and to solve gravity's first-order and fifth-order solutions. 
In a preferred interpretation of the Dark Energy equation of state, we find that the renormalization principle can lead to the time-dilation of the universe, regardless of the cosmological model in which the curvature constant varies with time. We show that the observed correlation between time delay and the decay constant (this, together with the conformal asymmetry relation) in the WMAP2, MOND and CMB images is due to the renormalization principle. Hence, we conclude that our universe is substantially more massive than is found from the well-known electromagnetic bias. 
The rationale for a huge survey of the Universe is to make possible a detailed analysis of large-scale structure which has the potential to study all galaxies up to $z \sim 6$. The study of gravitation is based on a basic combination of information about the solar system's structure and on theoretical predictions of the dark energy models that underlie it. Here we present the published papers, digitised from the imprint of the GRAVITY group and the Astrobiology Science Centre which are of interest to the space program. They cover the full range of astrophysical objects from point-mass black holes to objects with strong gravitational lensing signatures. By combining all these things together, we can trace, for the first time, the formation history of the Universe. The first tens of thousands of sources will be covered by the survey, which can provide a census of the distribution of mass and angular momentum in the Universe. In the following papers we summarize some of the results of the first and second year of GRAVITY research and present several examples of the process, all challenging to explain in terms of simple physics. We also briefly discuss the changes in the paradigm of small-scale structure and of the dark energy equation of state inferred by combining gravitational lensing and projection. 
The rapid bursts of electromagnetic (EM) waves detected in compact binary mergers can constitute some of the most powerful electromagnetic waves ever detected. Though even its frequency and frequency dependence remains unknown, these bursts have been crucial for testing general relativity in a way that makes them an attractive target for experiments using the gravitational wave astronomy potential. We report here a method of measuring the quadrupole moment of the electromagnetic spectrum of the Milky Way M31 stellar component due to gravitational waves generated by binary mergers. We use the covariance matrix method to explore the quadrupole moment function in the binary sector (continuum and star formation) in the Milky Way. We find that it follows that the quadrupole moment of the electromagnetic spectrum depends on the binary fraction of the stars in the system, and that there is a strong dependence of the quadrupole moment on the binary star formation rate. A sizable power law that does not exhibit strong coupling to stellar parameters dominates over the other quadrupole moments in the power spectrum of the electromagnetic spectrum in the galactic potential. Furthermore, the quadrupole moment of the spectrum depends on the binary fraction of the stars in the system (continuum and star formation). Our method is also independent of any assumed dipolar contribution to the Galactic potential. We conclude that while gravitational waves from the system can be reliably measured in different environments using the gravitational wave astronomy potential, any reasonable assumption regarding its coupling to stellar parameters may in principle rule out. 
We consider an idealized proposal for General Relativity, in which the extension of the Ricci scalar is connected with a Lorentz force. The energy and momentum of the scalar force are left as $\mu^2 = {k_z} \log K/L \dot{M}$, and $M^{*} = $k_{z} - \Gamma$ denotes the length of time it takes for the local theory of gravity to realize its equilibrium condition and beyond. The latter is the maximum value of the derivative of the Ricci tensor that exceeds $L$ for this interaction. The important properties of this theory are that it is compatible with modern numerical experiments that result in data coming from ultra-relativistic objects at high galactic latitudes, when both mu and L of the scalar force become constant. The "bottom-heavy" value of the wavenumber $t_{\rm b}$ is constrained from the WMAP data, which in its simplest form implies a non-trivial energy dissipation rate for both the lowest order derivative of the Ricci tensor and the stable one. 
We study the validity of several extensions of the so-called Domino Theory, whose dynamical meaning is investigated in detail by taking a particular view on the two-dimension dimensionality of a discrete polytropic spacetime. On the horizon we find that the Ricci Ricci curvature does not make a distinctive appearance at zero spatial scales, but is rather mediated by the Dirac curvature as well. In this view the radius of a spherical disc defined by a given degree of dimension, and the corresponding angular extent of the disc, are completely determined by the Ricci Ricci curvature and its geometrical counterpart. The Ricci Ricci curvature is real and there is a strictly fluid solution in this context. The potential of the Ricci Ricci curvature corresponding to a tangential coordinate of the disc is an infinitely far-uniform point. For one particular case where this point corresponds to an assumed imaginary metric and so is a constant, the Ricci Ricci curvature cannot appear in any term or at any associated sign at any time. Therefore the trajectory of a perfect disc would follow a single set of spiral spirals. We show explicitly that the horizon corresponds to a singularity of the Ricci Ricci curvature, but that when the horizon is a cubic space, it could belong to either the second or the third dimension. 
We study the growth of colliding black holes (BBHs) via CMB (1-point) statistics based on the coupling function of linear perturbations to the background. After considering the baryon fraction and the gas mass density, the cumulative growth rate of BBHs in the halos of galaxies shows, for the first time, that the total BBH mass is $M_b^* \sim 5 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ in $> 10^9 M_\odot$ of BBHs at $z \gtrsim 3$. This is, at least in principle, very close to the efficiency of spherical mergers in the evolution of galaxies, though higher BBHs are expected to form than lower BBHs when the infall velocity of hot gas is low. At high redshift, we show that the ratio of average BBH to gas mass is $2 \pm 3$ at 95% CL, a result that may be reconciled with a cosmic black hole at z $> 2$ if we include the "knee" effect. 
We present the theory of the Local Times relating local time and morphology. We then propose a first approximation of Local Times based on an elegant step-by-step formulation based on the cosmic chronometer and time correlation function. We give a general analysis of the global structure of Local Times, starting with a comparison of the Cepheid variables, the Sagittarius A* stars, the solar system analogs, the globular clusters and low redshift galaxies. Using the local approach, we demonstrate that the Local Times are linear solutions, whose fundamental timescales are long-lived, stable and stable, as well as their dynamics is a generic function of time. We also discuss numerical relativity and cosmic chronometers as probes of Local Times. 
I outline the current status of the multi-band data-driven observatory. I will discuss the new design and data reduction capabilities of LIGO's Cosmic Vision initiative, its planned launch, and the possibility to use the data in its implementation as an adaptive optics observatory. 
String cosmology models with a massive field theory consisting of scalar field fermions are discussed. In the presence of an intermediate component baryonic component, the inflaton is formed as a scalar in the form of a scalar with a length $f$. Hence, it can produce a standard model with a standard value of $f$ and a singlet in the Lambda-CDM background. 
We apply the kinetic approach to the cosmological perturbations and perform several tests to support the results. 
We analyze the dependence of fluctuations in the Higgs sector on non-local dynamical properties such as curvature perturbations, matter and coupling. It is shown that: (i) the value of the Higgs field fluctuation is affected by fluctuations in the matter field, as is previously shown, (ii) the fluctuations in the Minkowski potential have such large gradients that the difference between the fluctuations in the Minkowski and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich potentials must be small in the energy range 4 keV to obtain a non-zero variation in the curvature perturbation magnitude; (iii) the matter force leads to the higher curvature perturbation magnitude; and (iv) the Minkowski potential and matter perturbations act as a bridge to the Minkowski potentials by being tied to the curvature perturbations in the thermal sector. These results support the flat cosmology that is the so-called inverse-Square Field cosmology (IRF). The intrinsic dependence of the field fluctuations on the linear curvature perturbation strength of the Higgs sector of the universe also has important consequences on the equations of state of dark energy. In addition, the potential contributions from the Higgs-like physics to the Minkowski gravitational field are at the same level as the linear perturbations, even for an effective coupling scale equal to the weak-field coupling. It is shown that these results indicate a more accurate interpretation of the curved regime for the Higgs sector. 
We examine the interaction force of a particle with an outer ring of material and the solar corona. For the context of solar physics, we consider the particle transfer potential and the physics of trapped particles. In the circular corona, there is only a vacuum energy which leads to the time-dependent finite electric current. If the vacuum energy is finite in the inner part of the corona (where the corona is not ionized), then the collisional forces are treated firstly as a `emissivity-induced' current. We conclude that the self-energy of the particle, coupled to a temperature current, is proportional to the shear of the particles as they travel along the magnetic field line along the magnetic field line, and do not suffer from the force effect which is described in terms of the cross section for energy radiated at the outer edge of the corona. We discuss the violation of the stability of the torsion force by the product of an electron-electron spin, which is the geometry of the wormholes. We also describe an evolution of the interaction force in the bimodal corona and discuss implications on a single family of models with particle collimation. 
We investigate the possibility of mass transfer of weakly interacting massive particles via the collision of two black holes with e^-1 mu-pax stars on orbit about the main-sequence mass black hole. We use the surface gravitating motions of unbound stars, including stars and the central star, in order to derive observational constraints on the densities and masses of particles and on the motion properties of these bodies. In addition, we construct the data sets as functions of time at a given inclination angle. The results indicate that a fundamental difference between this study and the recent case of quasi-circular orbits is that there are such high-velocity small bodies (i.e., binary black holes). We discuss the advantages of this approach and point out the potential problems associated with numerical models of small bodies, especially those involving the generation of non-axisymmetric orbits. 
We present a closed-form expression for the gravitational radiation rate in gamma-rays from cosmic strings. The conservation equation leads to the prediction of a simple function of the power density of the graviton in linear gravity, that is the frequency of strings. Our resulting relation yields a universal result: for static external scale-free static degrees of freedom, the predicted curvature length (or curvature energy) is < 2.1 GeV/e^(-3). This value is a factor of 7.5 higher than the observed curvature energy and compatible with the observed values. The well-established limit of curvature energy is at around 10^{-5} eV. 
The inverse of power-law scaling relations of the cosmological density field as well as the potential-dominated power spectrum are used to derive scaling relations from the large-scale structure at the separation scale of $\sigma(z)=\sigma_8 \left( z=0.6 + z=0.2)$. The scaling relations are obtained by running Gaussian density-distributed entropy computations over different redshifts. At decoupling, the mean profile of the power spectrum, the sum of the power spectra and the power spectrum fluctuations at the separation scale $0.6$ and $z$ is defined in the form of a power-law. This decomposition is carried out with standard (log-normal) and semi-parametric integrators that can be easily applied to other cosmological models. A distinctive feature is that the scaling relations at separations $0.6-z$ increase by a scaling factor. This shift reduces the variance of the statistical error on the power-law at decoupling, and allows for a fast determination of the cosmological parameters. Moreover, we find that the non-Gaussianity bias typically exceeds the uncertainty for $z>0$, and, moreover, the mean luminosity distance has been set below the precision for $z<1$ given the statistical uncertainty of the signal. The consistency of the scaling relations at decoupling is further discussed. 
Observations with the \textit{Kerr satellite} and {\em Chandra} show that the initial \textit{halo} density field depends significantly on the dust scale height and luminosity. Inhomogeneous dust, and a large part of that is required for homogeneous evolution, significantly affects the collapse rate. We show that this effect is more robust for $\Omega_m$-free dust models compared to those with an initial density parameter $a_0$. We also explore the interaction between the initial data and the data and find that (i) the initial data become entirely more sensitive to the information contained in the initial distribution of dust density (mainly the size of the dust troughs; ii) the \textit{Halo} structure is significantly altered, resulting in even larger $\Omega_m$-free fractions in comparison with larger $\Omega_\Lambda$-free models, suggesting that the physics underlying dust growth is still not fully understood. 
We investigate gravitational radiation from a class of cosmic string loops with a different fraction of energy from the point source spectrum, which may be suitable for direct detection of any kind of cosmic rays. The loop superposed on an axisymmetric background is usually considered in modified gravity, which is shown to be a viable solution to the problem. Considering only three parameters, from the equilibrium formulation of the model and the action of the loops, we conclude that the loop superposed on an axisymmetric background is rejected for a wide range of applications. We show that the extreme value of the energy density can produce a distinctive spectral shape, a hard spectrum, and a faint upper limit on the distance to a point source. Our results suggest that a model consisting of loops with equal-energy components could be useful for detecting radio bursts. 
The generation of a new set of statistics in the observation of black holes in gravitational fields has been thought to arise from a natural tendency to accumulate as a function of mass and/or redshift (depending on the expectation of the expansion rate). While this may involve different effect of the mass of a halo, the progenitor of the radiation field must have an effective vacuum energy, which implies that the arrival time of the new quantum numbers. In this work, we examine the formation of a new set of statistics by the specific inclusion of a radiation field at one of two potentials for the radiative-lensing technique: a two-dimensional numerical formulation of the ionization spectrum (s1) and a one-dimensional numerical implementation (s2) of the de Sitter stage of the radiation field. We find that in the s1 case, the generation of a new set of statistics is driven mainly by the efficient compactification and ejection of the fluid energy and energy density $\xi^{-\alpha}$, while in the s2 case, the generation of a new set of statistics is driven primarily by the quenching of the gas. At all redshifts, the nucleon abundance and other properties of the newly forming stellar mass ($\xi \lesssim 2$) are the most prominent feature. 
Collisions of the inflationary black holes can generate gravitational waves, which are believed to be cosmic shear waves produced during coalescences in the early universe. In this study, we consider gravitational waves produced by the contraction of a boosted black hole on a rotating disk at $\sim1000$ solar masses, observed during low-inclination interactions with the electromagnetic field from the disk at the time of primordial gravitational waves. The mass of the disrupted black hole, $m_0 \geq 20-40~\textrm{M}_\odot$, depends on the inclination angle of the central black hole and on the equation of state of the black hole. Collision of boosted black holes and spinning disks, together with the process of accelerated expansion of the universe, produce electromagnetic counterpart of gravitational waves detected by the space-borne telescope EGRET. Assuming that the gravitational waves emitted by such gravitational waves would be detectable by other instruments such as GTC, the detection rate of gravitational waves from the remnant black hole would be as high as $\sim 10^{-8}$. This result is confirmed in a simulation performed with the PCA code JEM-X. In the simulated gravitational wave transients (GWs), we find that when the mass ratio of the disrupted and spun black holes is $\sim 10^3\rm{M}_\odot$, GWs will generate gravitational waves which have not been observed by the gravitational wave observatories JEM-X or MAGIC. We study the possibility of detecting gravitational waves from GWs with the GTC/EGRET-like telescopes, and argue that gravitational waves signals from GWs would be detectable in high-precision and consistent with GW searches at the JEM-X and MAGIC/EPL-like telescopes. 
The cosmological perturbations due to inhomogeneous matter in the early universe have been considered as a possible explanation for the power spectrum of the microwave background. The primordial acoustic oscillations in the background have been calculated for a specific redshift interval and mean density perturbations are derived in different cosmologies and were used as a basis to construct a set of anisotropy maps of temperature fluctuations on the sky. This approximation can be used to study the effects of inhomogeneities on the fluctuations and to constrain the standard model predictions. The anisotropy is generated by adiabatic expansion of the density perturbation with respect to the density gradient, with various indices increasing as it decreases. A sharp difference in the anisotropy maps of density perturbations can be observed in particular for the weak gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background. The anisotropy depends not only on the covariant scalar perturbation but also on the amplitude and asymptotically-extended power spectrum. These amplitudes, while very small, are quite significant. The sound speed dependence of the power spectrum is clearly visible in the power spectrum maps when the amplitudes are combined with the mean density perturbation. 
One of the main properties of gravity-driven acceleration of the cosmic expansion is the existence of a universal expansion coefficient, $a_0$, that corresponds to the density scale $c_{max}$ (in units of the graviton mass) of a current fluid of that pressure. It is known that in general, for decelerated $a_0$, $0$ starts to be consistent with its gradient. Here we will derive the derivative of $a_0$ using an exact new approach with a constant second derivative $a_{0}$ and adopting the non-negative solution to a four-point function $b_{0}$. The study of the spatial and pressure evolution of cosmic expansion is accomplished through the action of the gas in $a_0$ starting from a cosmological constant and accelerating expansion. It is shown that a standard fluid accelerates even at very small spatial scales up to scales of several kiloparsecs. In addition, we also present an exact analytical solution with a self-consistent matter fluid and show that the graviton mass cannot be zero and can be much smaller than it is today. This results in a generic gravitational term of $a_0$, $d=0.3$, as indicated by the numerical solution of this study. In this work we perform the first time investigation of the graviton acceleration in the presence of non-zero $a_0$. The second application to inflation is discussed in detail, showing that the effective equations of the system converge into a piece-wise universal relation in the limit $a_{0}\le1$, leading to a cosmological constant in the limit $c=1/c^3$. 
Interiors of multiple stars are the best examples of mechanisms where gravity beyond General Relativity and modified gravity have been strongly enhanced by higher-order post-Newtonian gravity. However, effects on the two forms of the initial conditions for two different forms of the scalar field can leave a distinctive signature in the light curve of dark matter models. Here, we perform a detailed analysis of models of the non-singular gravitational inflation model for stars consisting of a dark, Lagrangian spheroidal or double-cluster component, and a one-dimensional non-zero inertial, non-gaussian sphere, which are in fact slowly rotating at a specific inclination angle. We find that if the models have an inner radius of $r \le 0.3 R_\odot$, the dark matter induced gravitational-wave signal from the sterile neutrino decays past the effective radius of the scalar field and the radiation of the dark matter signal is amplified by an additional sub-GeV background radiation of $\sim 100\%$ in the absence of gravity. The resulting gravitational waves may propagate at a sub-GeV level, even if they do not contradict the expansion history. Furthermore, the gravitational mass fluctuations in the different models can be accurately modeled for a range of viewing angles. 
A consistent, moving theory of inflation is proposed, based on General Relativity, and followed up by the latest observations. The decay of the inflaton potential allows us to describe the observables in a spherically symmetric manner by observing the degree to which this method reduces to a Lagrangian. In this way, we are able to determine precise bounds for various quintessence models with arbitrary behavior and, in turn, constrain the scale-invariant adiabatic curvature perturbations that govern inflation and its subsequent time evolution. We are also interested in ways to correct for inflationary effects in the standard model. 
We introduce and derive self-consistent analytical solutions for the Landau ghost of a bouncing black hole as a matter curvaton. We find in all combinations of the Galileon's second law of gravity that these solutions agree with empirical results. Allowing the Landau ghost and an Einstein gravity of first order solutions, we determine the effective Lorentz factor $f_{\rm ex}$. As a consequence, we show that the black hole horizon can be stabilized both by energy conservation and by the adiabatic friction of a Schwarzschild black hole. 
The linear perturbations of a scalar field are coupled to a perturbed vector field in the context of gravity theories where the mass fraction of an exponential ellipse is equal to the sum of the individual sum of gravitational and velocity fields. Since the angular momentum is proportional to the mass fraction of the field, and since these solutions are either static or interpolated, all solutions involving the kinetic term of the scalar field may yield exact solutions. In this paper, the perturbations of a scalar field are treated in terms of collisionless fluid particles (CDM) at arbitrary point locations in the Universe and the initial conditions in its cosmological dynamical evolution are treated as Euclidean (Euclidean) coordinate space. In particular, we demonstrate that the exact solutions with the kinetic term of the scalar field for which the initial conditions on the gravitational field are Eulerian and spherical do not yield exact solutions. When the local dynamics is Eulerian, the solutions have relative positions with respect to the local dynamics. 
A density profile of the Galactic rotation curve of two Galactic high redshift clusters is computed for the first time. The three simplest periodic models, with galactic rotation times and velocity dispersions are constructed and the derived cylindrical dimensions are investigated with small group edges and at bottom of the cluster. Using these analytic structures we demonstrate how in the absence of a stochastic density field gravity models such as Convolutional Neural Networks or Convolutional Neural Networks are capable of explaining the observed rotation curve geometry. We find that for relatively large dynamical distances and near-to-surface velocities the three most accessible models produce flat rotation curves; in contrast, in the presence of such small velocity dispersions and convective cooling the observed geometry is largely constrained by accurate rotation curve shapes. Using the predictions of the fourth and fifth models in this study we find that the proposed mechanism of sustaining rotation at all dynamical distances from the Sun is two-fold: the density must be always well-lived for such cosmologically well defined radii; and the convective cooling must be significant because the observable region $\sim 20$ Mpc, $\sim 2$ AU, is considered to be the surface density boundary. Both of these considerations can be confirmed if asymptotic density perturbations are introduced at the level of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ to account for the extra velocity field required. 
We derive expressions for the set of harmonic moments between the lateral and longitudinal magnetic fields created by cosmic strings in single-field inflationary models. The formalism is simple and gives directly the exact expression for the set of moments. We illustrate the use of these expressions by discussing observational constraints on the linear growth rate of an inflationary string. 
Inflation is introduced in a special class of generalizations of the Poisson attractor. To derive the exact inflationary solution we construct a power-law potential $\alpha(\theta)$ via a Bayesian field theory formalism. With this new formalism we derive the equations of motion in the particle-in-cell regime. By combining both spectroscopic data and results of CMBT and SNe Ia, we find that inflation has a first order power-law behavior with a scale factor of $E_0$ $0.85$ \pm 0.003 at $15.5$ \sigma$ level with large $E_0\leq 150$ \sigma$. This, as a result, is $\Omega_m \approx 0.3$ $n$^{-1}$ with $n>4$. The spectrum is identical to that expected from the numerical Minkowski fluctuations. We also find the relation between the mass of the particle-in-cell regime and the inflationary period. This relation leads to $P(n) \sim (1+z)^{-2.5}$ for $\alpha(n)$, and leads to $n(z) = 0$ for $\alpha(n). We find also that the effective field equation for $n>2$ is equivalent to a model parameter $\alpha_{1}\sim 1$ in the range $1\leq \alpha_{0.4}$ and $2\leq \alpha_{0.8}$. We suggest that this value can be interpreted as the real value of the effective field equation at $2 \sigma$ level for this inflationary case. 
We develop the theory of everything with which all energy is conserved. We argue that this conservation occurs at the base of the system, through the Axion conjecture. In many systems the system, via a Jeans resonant process, is prone to infinite fluctuations and the Jeans effect (which is expressed as an attractor effect) leads to different curvature perturbations. In general the theory of everything with which all energy is conserved is not thermodynamical. It also requires exactly the same energy conservation terms, although the CMB bounds are not enough to guarantee that all energy is conserved. 
We demonstrate that remote sensing of inertialised Kerr black hole radiation has hitherto been somewhat unexplored, thanks to the limited sensing capabilities of current mid-infrared-separation receivers and by the shortcomings of IR telescopes. Here, we argue that such novel tools could be of great advantage if sufficiently sensitive quantum vacuum experiments can be conducted with high resolution with high photon densities (particularly of photon-numbers $\sim\dot{N}$) in the tens of milliarcseconds range. Thus, they are potentially a possible smoking gun of quantum vacuum energy spectra in distant, high-redshift systems. 
One of the main questions for black hole physics is how to reconcile the theoretical predictions of electromagnetic radiation with observations. New data on the diffuse emission line from the ISM is supported by the latest measurement of the temperature and density fluctuations in the innermost region of an extended HII region, where the density fluctuations are controlled by optical diffraction. We describe the relevant variations in intensity in the shell structure, and discuss their implications for the dust attenuation of the diffuse emission lines. In addition, we compare the physical response of the U-shaped/bipolar pattern to the presence of a magnetic field, and in particular the maximum magnetic energy input by the star-forming jet. 
We introduce a possible solution for the formation of black holes in a universe based on a certain set of $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models. A simple form of this approach is given in Sanyal et al. (2012), which indeed does yield a solution for black holes as late as $g=2$ in the beginning of the universe. However, the solution is slightly more extended than the ones of Sanyal et al. (2012), and the solution is possible without invoking extra dimensions. We also study that this new solution may also leave some questions regarding the physics of the black hole formation. We find that there is one explanation for these phenomena, namely the enhancement of the momentum transport due to small gravitationally bound black holes, which eventually becomes physical. This provides a possible conclusion which a new model can contain as a red-loop solution in an extended universe. 
The equations of quantum fluctuations of the cosmological potential of the universe are described in detail. The effect of the quantum fluctuation amplitude on the gravitation force is described. Results from the equation of the constant energy, plus the form of the background fluctuations are presented in comparison with the case in which the universe is collapsed. The effect of the fluctuations on the matter power spectrum and the charge anisotropy are compared. 
The existence of extremely massive superstrings may shed light on the dark energy model. To this end, superstrings must consist of some dominant class of massive objects which, although numerous, may be interacting via gravitational waves. The relevant mass of a superstring depends on the amount of supermercations induced by the gravitational waves and, therefore, the mass can significantly vary during the quasar lifetime.   We examine the possibility that such a fundamental mass range extends to superstrings that have velocities $v_g$ greater than $10^{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$. After undergoing a meridional overturn phase, the superstring interacts with the gravitational wave environment on time scales of months or even years, producing a brief (~ $\sim$ tens of kiloparsecs) nova. This afterglow has had a wide range of parameters explored in cosmology, including mass, strength, distance, Hubble type, spin period, spectroscopic properties, energy content, and the spectral index. We present a simple model, which is not only easy to implement but can be applicable to superstrings with masses as low as the mass of the black hole. In such a case, superstrings appear in great tension with observed black hole masses. We propose that after the gravitational wave radiation has passed, a scalar or tensor-tensor phase develops. We also show that the superstrings in this scenario are endowed with different properties depending on the mass of the superstring. The mass of the superstring might depend on whether it is ejected from a supernova remnant (SNR) or through a gravitational wave burst, but since these are strongly linked, superstrings could host gravitational waves-interacting massive objects such as black holes, black holes with periods of $\sim$100 Myr, or massive superstrings hosting such superstrings. 
In this paper, we present a framework for building three-dimensional hydrodynamics code that is capable of solving the physical equations of the atmospheres of stars and planets of different densities, that incorporate effects due to magnetic fields. The main goal of this code is the development of 3-D hydrodynamics models, which are consistent with the observations of pulsar timing observations as well as those of the TeV gamma-ray emission. To our knowledge, this is the first time that 3-D hydrodynamics is used in this way. The simplicity of the code and the one-dimensional setup provide a natural means for generating non-uniform stellar atmospheres and realistic sources of gravitational radiation. To expand the model into more realistic objects, we extend the model to four different spatial scales. The star's interior is represented by two geodesic and three gaseous spheres, as well as a heliocentric system of three stars; the astrophysical and energetic sources reside in the three-dimensional atmosphere, which corresponds to a horizontal stratification of the atmosphere which is not necessarily isotropic but may even have an important effect on the spectra of distant sources such as supernovae. This framework allows us to carry out more realistic modeling of sources of gravitational radiation including the emission of signals from pulsars. 
In this paper we propose a new analytic model to study the gravitational wave (GW) from a spherical (halo) central part of a rotating black hole. The model assumes a axisymmetric (causal) radius for the host black hole with a radius and an effective temperature. We find the following analytic behavior: (i) central part covers a much wider range of parameters than the black hole with radius. (ii) central part depends strongly on the Kerr equation. (iii) following the post-Newtonian expansion of the gravitational wave, the gravitational waves peak at larger radii. We derive the formation equation of the GW, by showing that we are able to derive the quasi-stationary flow dynamics. Finally, we determine the gravitational wave spectrum of the black hole and prove that the neutrino emission can have a strong GW signature. 
Based on the one-dimensional $\Lambda$CDM scenario in which two fluids are interacting through the knee, we investigate the effect of a relativistic interaction on cosmological perturbations, especially the mixing rates. In our first approach we calculate analytically the systematic perturbation amplitude due to thermal superfluidity of baryons. We present a calculation that fits in many nonlinear regimes, including partial non-Gaussianity. After analyzing the dependence of the perturbation amplitude on the particle strength, the results are in agreement with numerical simulations. In particular, we find that for moderate particle fraction the perturbation amplitude is subdominant over the $\Lambda$CDM case, and vice versa. 
We analyze the cosmological phase-space fluctuation statistics in a initially inhomogeneous universe including negative and positive decay channels. The decaying channels are assumed to be strongly redshifted and also to be located in an inhomogeneous manner. We then perform 3D simulations to compare their observables. They show that for sufficiently large positive fluxes the effects of the decay channels become strong. For negative fluxes we can achieve high inflation rates, which increase by a factor of $\approx30-40$ in a few tens of years and by about 10$^4$ in a few tens of years. 
Nonaxisymmetric instability has been suggested to account for the observed bright ($\sim$400 Mpc radius) diffuse emission from binary and star-forming galaxies. Whether a nonaxisymmetric instability is a direct consequence of such instabilities or an indirect consequence of gravitational radiation from the object is uncertain. In this paper we study the stability of the gravitational radiation from the oscillating nonaxisymmetric unstable system L80. We firstly calculate the gravitational potential arising from this instability by using a multi-messenger approach, then we analyze the gravitational waves emitted from this instability by the pulsar pulsar wind nebula as well as by gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by PAMELA. In both cases, the simulations suggest that in the long-wavelength frequency range $\geq 0.02$Hz, the progenitor can be an astrophysical black hole (BBH) composed of a black hole and a neutron star (NS). However, in this context, if the progenitor is the BHB, the instability is compatible with observational data showing that the emission from L80 is isotropic and the density is within 10 times the quasar density. 
We study the final fate of spherical collapse via a three-fluid steady-state model of dust collision. We assume the infall phase as a very local collapse of a cylinder of uniform density which is a purely ionized universe filled with cosmic rays and local hot dust. Then we show that, using a thermodynamical model of the core of the dust cloud (Fokker-Planck) we recover an exact description of the collapse of the dense cold dust. Assuming that the dust is compressed (e.g., a Roche lobe in the very small region of the turbulent $r$ plane), it has a collapse phase at the very end of its final evolution. At the bottom of the collapse, the infall is followed by an acceleration phase that lasts for minutes after the moment of inertia is reached, followed by a core-accretion phase, followed by a cooling phase followed by an expanding collapse phase. 
We present a model for the formation of a single long-distance cutoff in the near-to-mid-infrared spectrum of the Kerr spacetime. The cut-off is based on either the recently introduced electron neutrino fraction, or on the numerical method of scaling the matter power spectrum with energy. Our model is specific to the plasma as well as its photon energy, and possesses a nonzero time-dependent free parameter, the background photon mass. Thus, the cut-off at short distances from the underlying compact object arises from the symmetry breaking induced by matter cooling processes. In this work, we derive a possible mechanism for the cutoff formation in terms of a single field term. When this term is added to the general relativistic equation of state, our model allows us to suppress and even relax the temporal oscillation instability (SOLA) of plasma in the non-equilibrium medium, allowing to support a coherent plasma dynamo. Finally, we estimate the cutoff luminosity and magnetic field strength as function of the two fields, for which we find a minimum effective field strength of K=60 eV, corresponding to an effective field strength of V=86 eV. Our model may provide a way to confront some relevant experimental limitations on the generation of cutoff and the structure and growth of structures in the external space-time of spacetimes. 
We study charged Type I supernovae (SNe Ia) and the connection between their host black holes (BH) and their host galaxies. Our unified model assumes that Type I supernovae (SNe Ia) in SNe Ia host initially small black holes and turn violent as they inject supernova ejecta. At the shock top, the expanding SNe Ia accelerate the surrounding gas into supernova explosions. We estimate that at least 25% of SNe Ia will have accelerated stars over a time interval of about ~10^4 yr. To facilitate successful SN explosion, we show that the conditions for accelerated star formation in pre-explosion cores are very favorable, allowing BHs to escape from the shock by way of escape-source mergers and Lyman-alpha supernovae. In addition, SNe Ia can accelerate stars beyond the virial radius (R). In this picture, the observed rate of acceleration from SNe Ia to black holes at high R exceeds 1%, providing a plausible explanation for the cosmological reionization and post-reionization observational gaps. In addition, our model includes particle transport in the Eddington limit and offers the possibility of generating Lyman-alpha supernovae. 
Current techniques for determining the $\Omega_{\rm iso}$ of the intergalactic microwave background radiation are weak. More sophisticated probes of the fine-tuning of these methods have, however, yielded strong improvements. In this work we make use of recent developments in the neutrino oscillation-to-electron ratio of the sky distribution, to study the $^{12}$-$\delta$ symmetry and the $^{13}$-$\delta$ dominance of the radiation flux along the line of sight from distant compact galaxies. We show that the relativistic blackbody force can plausibly be a detectable species in the $^{12}$-$\delta$ asymmetry and that the same forces affect the spectral response of the galaxies' spectra, suggesting that significant deviations can be accommodated in the possibility of global coupling between $^{12}$-$\delta$ and $^{13}$-$\delta$ due to $^{12}$-$\delta$ enhancement by the cosmic microwave background radiation. In addition, we calculate the cosmic microwave background potential using these new results, and give analytic expressions for the $^{12}$-$\delta$ asymmetry $\nu_{\rm dip}$ and the Coulomb coupling parameter of the $\delta$ asymmetry $\beta$. We compare our calculations with observations and calculate how we constrain our parameters, both theoretically and via numerical methods. 
We estimate the scattering processes that cause the energetic scattering of atoms in the energy-momentum tensor of a spinning black hole with the Planck scale. These scattering processes are influenced by the small scale acoustic distortions of the space-time, and by the slow phase transition between the Landau rate and mass flux in the infrared. We show that it is possible to distinguish between scattering products of different spectral types, provided the typical magnitude is smaller than ~ 0.1. The scattering of very compact objects may occur in small particles without interstellar scattering. We also show that the spatially flat scattering profiles that characterize the massive radio sources at Planck can be caused by the velocity correction caused by the off-nuclear scattering of the extra-spiral regions as they propagate through the dark matter, as expected in a Schwarzschild black hole. 
Polarization limits on the gravitational radiation emitted by neutron star mergers can be tightly constrained. We show that the assumption of linear correlation between pulsar spins and stellar mass is inconsistent with the gravitational radiation from coalescing binaries. Furthermore, if spin ratios and mass are comparable, the inferred ratio can be varied, assuming a typical $\gtrsim12M_{\odot}$, for both the gravitational radiation and spin ratio, i.e., a common value. We further show that the polarization correlation induces a distortion of the radiation signal by mass and angular momentum caused by the rotating stellar mass, resulting in both polarization and mass distortion. The proposed measurement of the degree of polarization depends on the assumed linear correlation between pulsar spin and stellar mass, $M_{\ast},$ and the value of the linear correlation, $M_{\alpha},$ for both $M_{\ast},$ and $M_{\alpha},$. This modification may be important for future precision measurements of the pulsar spin, as it allows to isolate the effects of spin alignment on the gravitational radiation. 
While the the evolution of the energy spectrum of the effective model for black holes (MBH) is known from quantum mechanics, there is still a large amount of matter in which the total energy spectrum differs from that of the radiation pressure. Therefore, energy spectra obtained from the effective model have to be accounted for. I present a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of the effective and non-effective mappings and the corresponding equations of state, and present a simple expression for the phase transition in the energy spectrum of such a model. It is found that, while the non-effective approximation produces low amplitude high power spectra with very complex energy spectra, the effective model satisfies certain conditions. 
It has long been considered that reheating anisotropies from extra dimensions are non-trivial because they vary only modestly by a factor of two on large scales. However, a systematic uncertainty on the inflationary spectrum could be reduced if the extrinsic scale at which the anisotropy peaks decreases is a key parameter in the inflationary models. Here, we calculate the spectrum of reheating from extra dimensions, taking into account the thermal bath of the inflationary power spectrum. The upper bound on the number of reheating degrees of freedom to be suppressed is 50% (6x10^-15). It is found that the higher values of the reheating degrees of freedom and the upper bound are negligible for a scalar field with a dipole tensor, whereas for a non-zero index of the scalar field anisotropy the spectrum of reheating below the dipole becomes too fine tuned and a change in the index of the index becomes impossible, leading to the ejection of reheating electrons. 
The space weather, including gravitational wave events, have produced a wealth of observational data and new perspectives of what can be achieved from space. Here we outline the science drivers, the detectors, and future prospects for space weather. We present the Space Weather Prediction Network (SWEN) for planned space mission instruments. The ten key areas for SWEN are: (i) Catching Gravity Waves to Model Transient Events: Astronomical, Space Weather, and Transients. 
In this work, we consider the charge cycle dynamics of charged black holes, in the framework of quadratic gravity. We use two recent contributions of the reformulation with elastic vector and quadratic dimensions of charged black holes, by Pekniak, CeCenn and Mahlavi, both in the literature. We compute the charge cycle dynamics of charge-charged quark gas over a range of the parameters $z\gtrsim 1$ and $H_0\gtrsim 1.1\,z\,z\,h^{-1}$ respectively. We identify the existence of charge-tied black holes in a period of time of (statistical) existence, as well as a quiescent state and a slowly declining state. While the formation of a spherically symmetric black hole in a steady state might lead to such a state, the formation of a rapidly expanding black hole, when it quiets down under a pressureless magnetic field, might lead to such a state. In addition, when the $\tau$ forces the solution of the problem to be determined, we demonstrate that the existence of a rare condition of quiescence in the generation of an embedded black hole, indeed an equation of state, is identified, which reduces the necessity for black hole formation in such a scenario. 
One of the factors that determines whether there is a cosmological constant is how far out it is. We show that estimates of the age of the universe given using various cosmological models are insufficient to determine if the universe is long or short lived. According to the standard cosmology, the ages of the universe are typically 3 to 6 Gyr. Considering the Hubble constant as well as the Omega_m of galaxies, the distance to the Sun depends on the cosmological constant. We find that there is no distance to the Sun from the Sun for any assumed constant. It seems that there is only a very small uncertainty in our determination of the distance from the Sun, at most 5%, for a standard cosmology. In this work, we discuss the implications for the next generation of cosmological surveys and their implications on the present day universe. 
We consider the energy density fluctuations in a cosmological model, and show that those fluctuations tend to fall into one of three categories, namely, that steepest density fluctuations (which dominate over the rest of the dark matter model), slowest density fluctuations (which dominate over the first dimension), and extended fluctuations (which dominate over the Universe in the second dimension). We compute the allowed choices between these three classes, and propose the simplest and most elegant model for inflation. The extended fluctuations are small at any pressure, suggesting that the dark matter produced in inflation is significantly larger than that produced by standard inflationary models. The normalized slow and fast density fluctuations form a tight class, meaning that both have equal energy density to energy density fluctuations. However, we find that the second class is very difficult to implement and difficult to obtain. The corresponding physical parameters are arbitrarily small, showing that the cosmological model is viable. We then study the fit of the inflationary data, and find that, although the approximations used in the form of an exact power-law are found to be unable to reproduce the observed spectrum of the rate of growth and the observed size of the Universe, they are remarkably consistent with recent measurements and experiments, such as the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, the Planck Project, and the upcoming Planck 10m telescope. 
We study a supersymmetric supersymmetric Universe in a quintessence-neutrino phase, defined in terms of an uncorrelated scalar potential. Our experiment is based on an inflationary kinetic model, where the dominant scalar field interacts directly with the inflaton field in a quasi-steady state. In a general context of the general relativity, we show that two non-linear inflationary scenarios, with unknown eigenmodes, can produce small fluctuations, large perturbations of the inflaton field and curvature perturbations of the inflaton light. We compute their joint effect and compare with a supersymmetric gauge field model. We demonstrate that this result does not depend on either the form of the dark energy equation of state, the cosmological constant or the phantom energy equation of state parameter, and that it is independent of the scale factor of the scalar field. The consequences of non-Gaussianity are discussed and some alternatives and constraints are given. 
We report on an 8 sq. deg. rotationally averaged 3D quadratic 2D Gaussian component for a complete set of seventeen sparsely sampled UV/X-ray-selected spectroscopic galaxies selected from the accretion continuum of the fully distributed Active Galactic Nucleus FR-1530b. We use {\sc im}BAT, an advanced adaptive-optics, beam-layer database, to calibrate the BEHAVIOR continuum and determine a new realistic calibration parameter, both for large and small galaxies in the sample, based on the geometry and geometry of the galaxy core. A calibrated monochromatic continuum spectrum at 1.4 keV is simultaneously generated from single- and two-temperature, both multi-temperature, as well as microwave, line lists of the C, N, O and Ne transitions. A new 3D Gaussian component for each galaxy, with a homogeneous optical depth, is derived for matched and matched catalogs. Together, these data present both a greater frequency of absorption and smaller H-alpha flux in regions with weaker ultraviolet emission. We determine a new linear relationship between apparent magnitude and cross-correlation length, indicating that a spatial extent and brightness of a disc around a galaxy with a negative intrinsic magnitude (a 'greater HI forest') may still exist, and that the magnitude distribution of the disc in the redshift range 0.20 < z < 0.55 may still be complex. We conclude that the mean absolute magnitude of the X-ray selected galaxies may be -3.7/3.7 < z < 1.1 (sigma = 1.5/3) - somewhat fainter than the stellar magnitude in a population that includes Tully, Sagittarius and Aquila (at 3 < z < 3). We also find that, with the inclusion of suitable fields of view and correct foregrounds (including which galaxies should be detected in future spectroscopic surveys), the primary spectral index of an AGN is positively correlated with the star-formation rate for both high and low-mass galaxies. 
We study the fine-tuning of small, isotropic pulsed oscillations in a braneworld with a flat cosmological constant. Starting from the latest Riemann-Pitaevskii relaxation solution and taking into account its two-point effect, we formulate a detailed model which reproduces the inflationary horizon constraints for certain examples of brane-world scenarios: a single inflationary phase at the onset of inflation, or a combination of this and the de Sitter phase. A realizations of the potential violating fluctuations as a function of $\bar{\Omega}$ is achieved, assuming that both rims are concentrated in the direction corresponding to $\bar{\Omega}$ and that a discontinuous spectrum of small disturbances is emitted at the same place. The modulus- and phase-dependent oscillations power spectrum is shown to be invariant with large amplitude and long periodicity, while the density perturbation oscillation spectrum exhibits a slower and more stable mode than the perturbation spectrum. In contrast to earlier works, this study proves that due to the fact that scalar perturbations, which produce the observed oscillations in the data, suffer from finite resonant scales for time long enough for perturbations to efficiently evaporate. 
We summarize the major features of gravitational wave (GW) progenitor inspiral using a joint derivation of the binary binary signal, with the help of common-place methods (3D velocity and time-dependent light curve fits). We focus on population synthesis models using neutrino-capture fraction, as well as on the propagation of the binary scalar radiation. We apply analytic probability distributions to the many studies of non-axisymmetric systems, including the N-body simulation of Vlasov-Bruno (1999), based on the assumption that the NFW is invariant with respect to non-zero mass. In both cases, the binary component (the spin of the spin up supermassive black hole) is identified as the source, and predicts the dark matter dynamics to the second order in the DM dispersion parameter. We also examine two experiments: both the NFW and the Fast Radio Burst Experiment. At the high end, neutron star candidate (NSFJy) can be used to probe the explosion and possibly the thermal history of a pulsar, and at low orbital inclinations, LSST can give constraints on the collision rate and the inner dynamics of LSST, since a NSFJy explosion rate can be measured by comparison to an LTE explosion rate (although any such an estimate needs time of minimum). We argue that none of these constraints can be satisfied by LSST on cosmological questions, even with improvements in timing and duration of observations. We provide an exhaustive review on the observational constraints coming from other telescopes, including the WFIRST, VERITAS, and EGRET datasets. 
A revision to the geometrical and cosmological constraints on baryogenesis is presented. The initial conditions and their quantum dissipation are written in terms of a set of quantum pulsar equations which is publicly available for the first time. The problem of the structure formation of wormholes is addressed in detail and confirmed by simulations and data. The constraints on gravity (inverse constant) and black hole mass of dark matter in the early universe can be used to constrain in particular the initial conditions. An analysis of the expansion history of structure formation is also presented. A calculation of the cosmic string properties is also presented for two cases. The results in BOMG and QANG-hope correspond to a stable cosmic string. 
By considering the contracting dark matter scenario of gravitationally interacting dark matter particles, we show that the observed distribution of "bounds" and "Herschel map" energies, which strongly depend on the local gravitational potential, is consistent with the general Friedmann-Robertson-Walker theory. 
We discuss how numerical simulation methods can identify gases that exhibit high fluorescence intensity, such as the hydrogen in AGNs and ejecta in active galactic nuclei. We show that in many astrophysical environments, even without considering the environment in which they are being observed, models of astrophysical conditions can produce outflow signatures and emission that can be detected only with limited scattering efficiency. We propose that it is the environment in which emission originates that makes transition from a very fluorescent ionizing source to a high degree fluorescent emission. We show that, by employing realistic effects such as microturbulence, turbulence and photoheating, radiation traps and gas diffusion can produce transitions that are insensitive to the ionization environment in the ionizing source. We demonstrate that this prescription can potentially be applied to many astrophysical regions, provided that significant differential photo-ionization is not included. 
A new mode-based stellar thermodynamics code, MAGNETIC-4, uses an advanced full-metal magneto-hydrodynamics simulation code to study the complex and gradual evolution of pulsar spin fields. The code combines simulated observations of magnetic fields and a radiation-hydrodynamics treatment to derive internal structure for magnetic toroidal fields and conductive toroidal torques that lead to accurate-rate equations of state. The overall BVRI-electric field consists of a two-fluid convection (also known as convective toroidal field) flow that exhibits a self-consistent equatorial-inversion system. Unlike previous magnetic toroidal field calculations, however, this method fails to describe the evolution of magnetic field structures, resulting in self-similar magnetization. Magnetically thick precessing convection flows form near the neutron star in time-scale of tens of years, resulting in fast spinning black holes. 
In a previous paper, we have analyzed Stochastic Inflation by developing an analytical approach to gravity based on the direct theory dynamics of static non-gaussianities. The general relativistic approach is valid to all potentials, and, however, it can have the opposite power when considering tensors with fixed energy, where the result depends on the static potentials. In this paper, we examine the field equations of inflation from the high-dimensional Hamiltonian approximation to Ricci scalar perturbations from General Relativity. Specifically, the numerical stability of the inflaton is considered, and in particular, the Minkowski-Maxwell potential is studied for both scalar-tensor and field dynamics in general relativity. In order to achieve the validity of our model, we also solve the linear field equations. We find that, even when the scalar perturbations are non-gaussian, the perturbations also follow the Lorentz force, providing a very stable limit on the scalar-tensor motion. In the weakly non-gaussian case, the field equations of inflation generate some sharp dips in the scalar perturbation potential, which can be interpreted as a function of the scalar-tensor time step, while the Sachs-Wolfe (SWE) gauge field is assumed to be completely non-gaussian. We argue that, for a physically flat universe, the evolution of scalar perturbations leads to a clear spectrum of spectral features in the vacuum. 
We carry out initial and secondary acoustic measurements with the USNO in the COSMOS-Neptune simulation. We aim to verify the Blandford-Znajek 1.4 model by simulating the evolution of the equilibrium white dwarf surface density and temperature as the effective distance increases. The measured acoustic spectral index is then used to probe the evolution of the chemical composition of the white dwarf. For each age the spectral index changes by 5-10 per cent. We measure the chemical composition and thermal and ionization states of the gas and analyze its growth to $m_{\rm snow}$ with the updated SNeIa mass ratio. We find that a re-analysis of the composition of the sedimentation layer leads to significant differences between the Teff and the temperature-dependent emission of the simulated white dwarfs. Using new fits to existing models we derive accurate evolutionary tracks for the white dwarfs using the extended SNeIa mass ratio. Comparison with our known sample of white dwarfs shows that our white dwarfs can be described by evolutionary tracks which are consistent with model results. We present this method for the comparison of different radiative cooling models and use it to constrain the parameters of the cooling flow, gas evolution and plasma mass. 
The energy inhomogeneities of primordial matter are shown to be weakly coupled to reheating quantum tunneling due to resonant scattering by photons. The quantum tunneling mechanisms are realized when photon scattering is ignored, however thermal signatures of quantum tunneling cannot be expected. Instead the most interesting quantum tunneling mechanism occurs in (outermost) spacetime where photon scattering is negligible. The recent Oort tension constraints indicate that the effects of quantum tunneling are less than those of other damping mechanisms. 
We examine semiclassicality and entropy of nonlinear coupling constants and possible deviations from Standard Model cosmologies with no baryogenesis. We consider a homogeneous and inhomogeneous universe, constrained by the free parameter and first-order mean square approximation, and find that the one-in-one effects associated with the quasi-static fluctuations are negligible to constraints on the chaotic quantities, depending on the presence of flat, vacuum, and lensing solutions. The size of these residual fluctuations increases in parameter space in order to probe the concordance between the standard model and cosmological observations. By accounting for this larger-scale deviation from the standard cosmology, we find that there are no grounds for imposing a background and exponential dependence of the stress parameter on the cosmological parameters. The hidden background effects present in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker formalism, such as shift-shift, octave scale, modified mass density, and temperature fields, are also within this model window. 
Cosmological perturbations are believed to play the key role in the acceleration of massive particles in the early Universe. In the past, only a tiny fraction of these perturbations, described by the squeezed fluctuations (QCs), have been measured in detailed numerical experiments to determine the effect of these perturbations. We consider here the effects of different CMB quantities, ranging from the local temperature and energy density fluctuations to the dynamical temperature and energy density fluctuations. We found that QCs have a role in constraining the primordial anisotropy and up to the third-order phase transition from the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) state to the CDM-dominated era. As this contribution is only relevant for the context of $f(R)$-gravity, the result should be less important in higher-dimensional analyses. The numerical results are validated using the extended definition of QCs of realistic cosmological scenarios in which the original primordial quadrupole moments have been introduced, a consistent quantum behavior has been established, the temperature scales are much smaller than that of the local temperature fluctuations, and the luminosity of the QCs are larger than those of the non-quintessential ones. Finally, the dynamical temperature fluctuations are shown to improve with increasing the CMB anisotropy and contribution to the primordial anisotropy in $f(R)$-gravity. 
We perform cosmological N-body simulations of a new model of quintessence with $Z_0 \propto z_s^2$. The metric satisfies general relativity and has a well-established decay time and mass model. While no viable cosmological model has been proposed, the minimal model is fit to both the total and the fine structure constant fluctuations. Despite our classical expectation, the Bianchi system is still sufficiently complete that the suppression of gamma-ray oscillations is observable in the near future, and can explain the very different luminosity statistics of type Ia supernovae and the large-scale structure of the universe. We show that the physics which makes up the system is thermodynamical; it can generate curvature perturbations to support spheroidal structure formation in stellar clusters. The first three periods of the duration of the hydrodynamic regime, and the third period of the gravitational wave frequency, exhibit a low-dimensional index that is independent of the Newtonian density. An extra violation of gravity in the system (via the gravitational constant) seems to have a strong effect on the perturbation amplitude, significantly lowering the gravitational wave amplitude at $\sim 5\sigma$. 
We introduce a new set of Scalar Entanglement Entanglement Algorithm for the calculation of the ratio of the resulting entropy due to all interacting scalar fields. We consider the Einstein's formalism for local gravitational perturbations and consider the Bianchi dynamics, considering perturbations arising from phantom fields. The method takes into account the internal dynamics of a scalar field while a general form of time dependent entanglement is also implemented. We calculate the entropy, which shows a consistency of the calculation with other algorithms in the context of quantum gravity. It is found that for an object which exhibits a polarization behavior of the entire sky at arbitrary angle at the horizon the ratio of the entropy to the matter is close to unity, but that for an object which exhibits a linear polarization behavior it increases by a factor of two. However, we show that an effect is not favored over the usual expectation value of the equation of state but is not likely to change the result. 
The Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) leads to the non-Gaussian behaviour of the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) background light curves. When one unifies the slow rotator and the early pulsar cosmologies, one can obtain a mixture of cosmic power spectra (SP) for all types of nuclei, except only $k_\nu = 0$, $\alpha_\nu = 0.01$ and $\gamma_\nu = -2.3$. The results for compact galaxies, are extremely sharp: the weak fraction of gravitational energy is then comparable to the luminosity of the observed cosmic background radiation by a factor ~ 2.5 in total, with a tight consistency. An equation of state parameter $w_a_0$ is a critical scale to estimate the constraints on physics within the framework of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and cluster physics. For the BL Lac objects, $w_a_0$ is less important, as in a local SMC, or will soon be constrained. In the SMC the constraint becomes significantly smaller. Finally, Big Bang nucleosynthesis may play a role in the low-frequency reverberation detection experiments, as we expect to find low-frequency narrow band resonances with future telescopes, from which there will be high-precision estimates on the baryon fraction. 
The Gaia spacecraft has been surveying with unparalleled precision every Earth orbit with unprecedented sensitivity to the detection of long-period comets. Two statistical methods of distance determination can be used to separate cometary debris and hot Jupiter comets in gravitational radiation: the RADIATION method and the DIRADONIC method. Since the most common uncertainty measurement was performed on two different types of cometary debris, many estimate uncertainties in the distances. In this paper, we estimate the uncertainties in the distances, using real-space data of the Gaia robotic mission. Based on our calculations, we determine the distances at which, among a few hundred comets, we expect to detect cometary debris between 16 and 60 au. The results agree well with measurements of cometary cometary motion. The characteristics of cometary cometary motion show that a high confidence of the estimated distances may be achieved if the cometary distribution in orbit around the Sun is evenly distributed throughout the Solar system. The consistent distribution of the cometary orbits suggests that high transit velocities can be detected from the perspective of transit velocities obtained by our differential translational distance method, as well as from the brightness of the cometary distribution on short time scales. 
Most modern cosmological tests invoke an acceleration process, starting with the ordinary distribution of the Universe, and ending at large redshift. The standard approach to verify acceleration requires determination of the field equations of motion in the Universe, without specifying quantities that can constrain acceleration. Motivated by the trend observed between small and large redshift, we revisit theories of acceleration in terms of cosmological parameters by providing a detailed treatment of a systematic degeneracy that can hide important error modes in the calculation of the contributions of cosmological parameters to acceleration. We extend the prior to include an explicit dependence of acceleration on cosmological parameters. 
Eccentricity ratios as strong as $\delta/dt=2$ are studied for the production of binary stars in a number of black holes. The orbit is formed by a mass that interacts with the accretion disk. For a certain Lorentz factor the result depends on the mass equation of state. We determine that the radius of the eccentricity as a function of the mass can be as large as $\rho^{-2}$. We confirm the existence of a local limit of the oscillating fraction at the outer parts of black holes of stellar masses $10^{-10} < \delta/dt < 10^5 \ {\rm M}_\odot$ where ${\delta} \approx 0.3$. The orbital behavior depends on the inclination angle and the angular momentum. We confirm a unique orbit of the PN 5635 in the rotation period of 4.9 years. With such an orbital configuration, the accretion rate drops by a factor of two and the gas phase is dominated by strong gravity. In a long period system the small fraction of the mass in the inner parts is created in a tidal wake, only about 50% of the mass in the outer parts is produced in a cometary wind, less than 30% in a low velocity wind. Since these features are accompanied by the capture of mass in the inner parts of black holes, the disappearance of large fraction of the mass can be due to the streaming mechanism. 
We analyze one generation of observed cosmological models to estimate the cosmological constants and the characteristic deviations from fully isotropic isotropic predictions, and the fitting power spectra of possible end states. These are relevant for setting cosmological corrections to the recent cosmological observables. These are obtained from model predictions of Newtonian potentials. Most observers are correct to those of most recent literature; we derive confidence intervals for the measurements and show how they are constrained in the presence of non-Gaussianities, and how the precise computation of these relationships depends on limits on the right- and left-handedness. 
Vacuum is a novel astrophysical concept which describes the past evolution of the universe and is characterized by a peculiar transition phase, as it appears from vacuum to two-dimensional, as it intersects the superposition of atomic and gravitational fields. Vacuum gives a unique opportunity to study this transition and its connection to the formation of a new cosmological black hole. Based on the Chameleon theorem we construct a class of vacuum models which can exhibit both a monomial and an exponential state. In addition, we analyze several other various effects that occur within vacuum models and show how they may evolve by the conditions that exist in a hypergravity. We focus on a general set of models where the two-dimensional conformal properties of the central bodies of a vacuum represent a typical property of a concrete vacuum with a high speed flow, and show how these properties may lead to oscillations, the energy budget of the medium, energy levels of quantum fluctuations and, as a consequence, the existence of a large number of free parameters, which determine the evolution of the universe. 
We critically address some recent criticisms of these two authors, claiming that in these two papers they neglected crucial parts of the transport equation. 
We discuss the properties of gravity and the computation of their current observables. In particular we propose a model where gravity is driven by a linearly coupled scalar field, generated by a decelerating field whose field tensor is coupled to gravity. The dynamical interactions of a gravitino with a hyperbolic field as a function of its quadrupole moment and a spherical harmonic of its curvature are expected to induce non-negligible corrections on the coupling coefficient, not just the tidal deformability due to the curvature effect. In other words, this is achieved only for a regime with stable couplings between the scalar field and gravity. In order to demonstrate the success of the model, we perform a study of the matter content of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker gravity field. We show that the properties of the theory are in good agreement with the measurements obtained in the early Universe. 
The influence of 2D polytropic spacetime is discussed. It is suggested to evolve the first order symmetric tensors in the early universe. 
We study the possibility that cosmic strings are broken without mixing with other pairs of halos such as white dwarfs, low-mass X-ray binaries, or neutron stars. We consider the thermodynamic structure of the ambient spacetime as a function of the particle density. Then we include self-gravity effects in the coupling determination by means of a simple procedure for the evolution of the cosmic string. At fixed density, the local vacuum is expanding in the vicinity of the spacetime. This leads to the string break, while increasing its expansion rate via the binding force and heating effect. The pair crossing occurs at $z \gtrsim 0.7$, while the thermal Comptonisation radiation plays a crucial role. 
In the perturbative framework the Friedmann equations are extended to third-order for all four elementary operators. In this paper, we introduce a renormalization method to solve fourth-order gravity field equations for all four operators of second order in fourth terms. The renormalization process uses space- and time-dependent and exponential variables which specify four different tree functions. We introduce the specific equations by applying them to the astrophysical scenario. 
We derive constraints on scalar-tensor gravity theories with effective action potentials. The requirements imposed by these theories are characterized by the constraints on $\Omega_{\gamma} \sim 0.01-0.02$ at the beginning and end of inflation. We combine the constraints from CMB data and WMAP and DR2 data to determine the tension level $t_C=r_c/r_p$, where $r_c$ and $r_p$ denote the true limit of the scalar potential. We have also used a recent inflationary model we recently developed to test the stability of such an effective action potential on inflation. We find that the consistent action potential cannot be destroyed by CMB data in any significant way. We derive further constraints on scalar-tensor gravity on $c$ and $r_c$ using a pairwise full-scale model which could affect them over an appropriate time interval. We also investigate some additional related applications of these frameworks. We discuss the implications for inflation and the sensitivity of such models to the growing universe. 
Topological defects are important for the formation of inflaton and non-relativistic particles, but a strong dependence on the collapse of a hierarchical system is observed in the early Universe. The leading elementary breaking and associated efficiency are computed. The numerical numerical calculation is done by incorporating the axion-like couplings to the axion field, to obtain a unique metric for the lower limit of the total energy density. The numerical calculations can be seen at the spine-shock theorem in the simplest models of non-relativistic preheating. Our calculations reach a low end in the absolute energy density but persist. The quantitative effects of the two inflationary regimes are discussed in the context of the phenomenological implications of the dynamic breaking. 
We review the phenomenology of gravitational waves generated from a binary merger, focusing on the total mass of the system. While the gravitational spectrum changes at sufficiently large scales, the spectrum evolves more slowly than the one obtained from a single source. In order to connect these distinct signals to the gravitational wave emission we must compare to those produced by a single source. In particular, we examine the effect of a discontinuity in the gravitational wave spectrum in each of the two gravitational wave detectors and in the ones operating in pairs of detectors. We propose a novel model based on a slow bounce approximation where the gravitational wave emission is detected at the close separations, while the emission extends beyond the binarity of a sufficiently massive binary companion. This fast bounce approximation is tested by the gravitational wave emission at the gravitational wave region of the prompt emission, which is used to test the implementation of the slow bounce approximation for gravitational waves from compact binaries. We find that the gamma-ray emission detected in gravitational waves with high signal-to-noise ratio will evolve with both the duration of the interaction and the mass ratio between the binary components in the binary compactity parameter space. A binary merger (or merger of a hydrogen-dominated star or a white dwarf with a hot circumbinary disk) is found to be very attractive for a fast bounce approximation for compact binaries. 
The rapid development of the near-infrared background using ALMA in the next decade will enable an increase in the amount of astrophysical gravitational waves detected. Recent advances in astronomical observing have resulted in the discovery of new masses of planets and of very young stars and black holes in our galaxy and beyond. In particular, gravitational-wave emission from these exoplanets and the possible evolution of the present-day SZ system on very high redshift would also benefit from the discovery of gravitational waves, in the first full-resolution detector on a compact test particle accelerator, in the recent SPH accelerator on the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, or elsewhere. Indeed, the gravitational-wave results are encouraging for the possible detection of possible direct gravitational-wave signals. 
General quantum cosmology in the context of traditional inflationary models is discussed and an experiment is performed to investigate quantum gravity. The results obtained are very encouraging. The fact that this potential is beyond the age of current theoretical interest can be explained if we consider an efficient Fermi mechanism which operates in the presence of de Sitter particles. We also consider the possibility of the same mechanism being relevant to some different inflationary models, for instance SNe Ia. 
The dark matter dynamics of the dark matter dark energy model is described by a scaling relation of homogeneous and bounded hyperbolic scalar-tensor bosons, for a two-world spacetimes: a perfect fluid and an all-\sqrt{\nir} manifold. In this paper, we investigate the maximum the attractor term yields for a system of four multipoles in the metric. The maximum of the attractor term is analyzed by a natural equation of state which was derived from supernovae observations of the compact galaxies NGC 6223 and NGC 6824. We find that under certain conditions the attractor term can decay, but only with different values of the hyperbolic tensor in the metric, which is responsible for some of the hidden anomalies. Moreover, our results indicate that for a given hyperbolic tensor, the attractor term grows rapidly with value of the hyperbolic tensor for decays with decreasing values of the hyperbolic tensor. We conclude that, on the other hand, the linear attractor term grows moderately faster than the generalized scalar-tensor attractor at $\sigma_8$ for linear supernovae measurements. 
Some properties of a single spacetime set up during inflation and its subsequent evolution as such may give rise to variable dimensionality or, equivalently, a strong suppression of baryons in the long-run. One way to describe such a scenario is with a generalized regularization of baryonic cosmological models, in which certain degree of inflation would be blocked by mass inflation. To obtain such a non-flat expansion history, we study a model universe with a halo dominated by a massive halo on an elongated disk. In addition, it is demonstrated that this model can generate a stable inflationary potential with baryons coupled to massive halos. We find that the observation of two distinct spiral arms and coherent galaxy clustering are confirmed by measuring fluctuations of the kinematics of the galaxies as they move through the simulation of both models. 
We investigate the final boundary condition of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum in order to determine its characteristics and to compare them with theoretical predictions. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum with photon index is well constrained, since it corresponds to the wavelength of the spectrum at which the gravitino interacts with the dark energy. For the cosmological scenarios considered, our result gives two results: (i) the CMB power spectrum evolves with increasing photon index in the large wavelength region along with the transition energy, and (ii) the spectral slope changes from the current cold dark matter model up to the very soft state of the Universe. This new result predicts a significant improvement in its geometric resolution from point-like observations, but depends sensitively on the coupling constant (or value of), which is constrained by observational constraints, and not the sensitivity of direct measurements. In the energy domain, the parameter $\chi$ in the experiment space corresponds to a region of cosmological constant, corresponding to the cosmological constant parameter, where $\chi$ is the multipole of the coupling constant. Our results also imply that the era of observational data sets is very different than the present one. 
If the values of the velocity dispersion and the power spectrum of the Galactic center supernovae are allowed to be used in a phenomenological analysis, we can estimate an estimate for the period of the formation of an apparent `messenger' traveling in opposite directions and accelerating through our Galaxy. This may allow us to have a crucial clue about the nature of the fundamental constants that govern the Universe. We compute the effects of various dynamical conditions on the accretion of a quasar and discuss how they may affect the inferred distribution of light-curve shapes and point-like optical and radio properties. 
Inflationary inflation is an attractive model for the evolution of the physics in which dark energy and matter resides. This hypothesis holds both in the matter and the electromagnetic fields. A more distant future will create a singularity. Recently the electroweak scale of the electroweak scale is resolved by another dimensionless model. We demonstrate that even if the axion temperature scales, the field potential in the squeezed-mode spectrum can be correlated with the large scale structure that is located in the squeezed-mode spectrum. The tensor to scalar ratio is several orders of magnitude larger than what is found in vacuum energy. This model promises a great improvement in sensitivity to the current status of the cosmological expansion. 
I review a novel model, the $\Lambda$CDM, of particle gravitational collapse using gravitational electrodynamics. Collisions of black holes with circularly-spaced gravitational-wave pulses deliver the angular momentum of the rotating neutron star to a minimally-fractal spinning black hole. The spin periods of the pair can be arbitrarily varied on orbits formed by the resulting black holes. Such pulsations can be tracked and identified and controlled by gravitational wave signals, with the goal of shedding light on the binary neutron star system. I then discuss the possibility of observing all of these signals using observations of gravitational waves. I find that gravitational-wave observations with the combination of ground-based interferometry and the next-generation ground-based radio interferometers such as PAMELA will complement observations of gravitational-wave emission. 
We perform a statistical analysis of the correlations between cosmological parameters and the clusters and groups observed in observed galaxies. In the simulations, we find that if cosmological constant is zero, its dependence on the observed parameters of clusters is remarkably similar to a value based on the local galaxy overdensity as in the WMAP simulations. Furthermore, we show that when adopting the black hole mass parameter of normal galaxies from the simulations we found an observable correlation in the clustering direction. The difference is probably caused by the environment in which cluster formation occurred, i.e. that the value of the baryon fraction within the galaxies is approximately a factor of 2 higher than the value inside them. We find that the presence of a small but not zero cosmological constant increases the importance of clustering in the cosmological simulation analysis. 
In this work we discuss scalar field dynamics, gravitons and gravity theories of interest in Cosmology and give detailed numerical methods for the construction of f(R) gravity models, including recent results on the field dynamic covariance of a scalar field. We then follow the development of f(R) gravity by introducing a new scalar-field numerical and statistical framework which is not computationally expensive. We find that, at an arbitrary frequency scale, theories featuring nonzero gravitational moments do not exhibit any stability phenomena when the scalar field couples to gravity in the dynamics of the field. Therefore, the dynamics of gravitational forces in cosmology is governed by the dynamics of gravitons. Furthermore, we test the conclusion that models featuring nonzero gravitational moments satisfy the first-order approximation, which gives the transition between the form of gravity and that of gravity in terms of mass functions. We also review the stability of theories exhibiting nonzero gravity moments, which only exhibit radial effects, after their numerical work is complete. 
We present here an application of the localization code Orazen to the data obtained for the VLBI energy range of gravitational wave (GW) sources at cosmological distances: A higher global validity of the Localized Object Lensing Functions (LOCFs) than the original version is demonstrated. This is due to higher amplitude localizations with improved reconstruction of the sky response compared to the original, even though no change in the residual circularization map was obtained on the sky position. We argue that the long-term and local results of the Localized Local Image (LIM) localization program can be used to aid local project planning, discuss improvement in the proper derivation of parameters and limitations in global localizations and verify improvements in terms of other measures of galaxy distances and galaxy angular power spectra. 
In the framework of the fully gravitational-hydrodynamical model of string loops, a number of general equations are presented for the formation of binary black holes, neutron stars, and satellites. This paper presents equations describing the evolution of a cosmic string loop, by considering modifications to the Lagrangian formalism and semi-analytic models for massive particles. Furthermore, after introducing a modification of the Boltzmann equation, we derive the Lauer equation and we demonstrate that in the neutron star-stellar (NS) system, the initial self-gravity coupling to the microphysics is very weak and this coupling is not taken into account if the black hole mass is too small. By invoking the simulation of the NS body as a mirror, this paper gives accurate measurements of the final gravitational potential, but does not capture the mass equation during the dynamical stage of the loop evolution, implying that the mass equation during this stage cannot be used to constrain the existence of black holes. 
For a gravitational wave event with energies exceeding the tens of GeV, $\nu$G lies on the above list of the sources that can be used as gravitational wave detectors. Depending on the neutron star physics models and unknown sensitivities of the experiment, for example, $10^3$ neutrons, $\nu$G is needed to search for these neutrons in the ground. We present here a unified multi-frequency theory of the analysis of the observables of large relativistic wave sources. In the limit of extremely small high energy flux, new nonlinearities can become important. We show that a number of features that have been previously identified with these gravitational waves are similar to those of $\nu$G, which is expected from their new quantum phonons excited by a nonlinear kinetic term. We also consider the effects of the inspiral of the neutrino-driven shock wave and show that they can make the inclusion of the nonlinear quantum phonon contribution significantly more effective. Finally, we discuss the implications of these new quantum phonons for the theory of recoils in the background of gravitational waves, particularly on the direction of observer. 
Recently, Moore and Heilinger (2006) introduced a novel mechanism that might break rapidly rotating stars in General Relativity. This mechanism only works if the initial timescale for the induced symmetry breaking of rapidly rotating stars is shorter than the neutron star's maximum lifetime. This has implications for the mass-radius and mass-time relation in general relativity, especially for the standard cosmological constant. Here, we show that it is possible for rapidly rotating stars to form dynamically unstable orbits in general relativity. We compare a widely studied star forming mechanism to a previously proposed self-gravitating equilibrium model of self-gravitating protostellar disks. We find that, when the predicted period of mass-transfer between the object and its companion is taken into account, the resulting scalar field can stay stable over much longer timescales, thus reducing the mutual deviation from gravity. In contrast to the classical binary dynamics, the symmetry breaking due to the tidal deformability of a slowly rotating star is important for the momentum conserving binary system of its host star. 
We use recent work on the evolution of scalar metric perturbations to discuss the development of an effective theory for inflationary cosmology in which scalar perturbations arise at early times, and that involve inflaton field couplings at late times. The origin of these power-law scalar perturbations in this theory is explored with the 2:1 model and with non-Newtonian gravity in a non-minimal field-inflation scenario. We find that the non-minimal models are consistent with the current observational data for a number of observable and parameterized model parameters, and can explain the number of detected Type Ia supernovae at high redshift. 
We study the effects of gravitational and electromagnetic fields on the non-convective cold solution of a charged tachyon with the same effective kinetic mass $m$. For this purpose, we consider the viscosity in a scalar field $\Lambda$ and its matter and gauge, while for gauge $m$ there are no spatial effects. For the viscosity we consider two cases. In the case with a gauge field, where one of the fields is linear, the Kerr coordinates have to be set to the compact center of the compact object. In the case with an electromagnetic field, where the scalar field can be non-linear, the Einstein coordinates have to be non-linear. Both cases are then different from one another. The first of the first class can be realized by a Kerr disc of local stationary symmetry of the matter and $m$ with the right side of the Kerr axis and the other is a transverse field of relativistic symmetry. We obtain the properties of a tachyon with field $m>m$, as well as analytically the background physical conditions, including density distribution of the matter, for the scalar field and gauge in the viscosity case. We find that these parameters depend on $m$ and on the order of the Kerr coordinate. Therefore, non-linear effects in $m$ can also dominate in the non-lens limit and we compute the dispersion measure of the scalar field in this condition. 
We study in a simple analytic framework a recently proposed approach of estimating the maximum energy and momentum of cylindrical gravitational waves. We use a strict adiabatic scheme to solve a Lagrangian which is known as the electrostatic equilibrium (EE) condition. In the present work, we apply our method to the case of a spherical harmonic oscillation in a fluid. We obtain exact expressions of the waveform and its radial power spectra with various mathematical solutions. We illustrate these expressions on the recent results of the $\mathcal{A}$CDM class of dark energy models by comparing their radial and density distributions. Our results are quite similar to the earlier results that show that the energy and momentum of the double density is different from the total energy. We compare this result to the analytical results that have been presented earlier, showing that the analytical results favour a spherical power spectrum with the energy well represented by a decelerated (low-energy) power spectrum. 
A unified approach to the phase space equation is developed to describe gravitational-wave observations of dark energy signals. On the first seeing of the gravitational waves a nearly vanishing dependence on the number of components is obtained. Within this framework a spectral decomposition is performed for linear modes and it is shown how this results in a promising diagnostic tool for searching for dark energy signals with the Square Kilometer Array. 
Recent results on the the application of gradient expansion to the nonlinear gravitational wave (GW) signals from distant background sources to generalised equations of state (EOS) of cosmology may be useful for interpreting the ongoing GW observations. As a final point, we point out a possibility that GWs can originate from massive, diffuse astrophysical sources with particle masses up to ~10^{10} eV. If these astrophysical sources were relativistic, then the GW emission may be produced in phase-resolved turbulence which is maximally connected to the underlying large scale inhomogeneities that are induced by stellar wind interaction. The procedure to derive the constraints on the diffusion parameter and the mass of the dust source is here presented. 
We investigate the magnetically sheared equatorial Rossby wave plane in 3D self-gravitating super-planetary disks (SCs) around known active galactic nuclei (AGN) using the Simulated Stellar Hydrodynamics in the Stokes profiles function (SCMF). We use the approach of rotating a star to mimic the position of the equatorial sheared Rossby waves in SCFs. We investigate the magnetically sheared curvature of the equatorial Rossby wave plane and find that a disk with four sides is sufficient for this purpose. Based on simulations, we conclude that rotating, sheared nonaxisymmetric disks can be surrounded by a unstable large-scale unstable edge if a single solid body (within the perturbative approximation) is fast enough to set the critical torques which may be needed for such a presence. 
Scalar--Tensor Cosmology (S3) involves the functional form of two solutions, a scalar field plus a zero non-zero scalar field, arising from the kinematical transformation of the vector field into the gravitational field. In a recent paper by Brueckner (1996), we considered four scalar field solutions, representing different Schwarzschild metric-momentum solutions, and set up a new supersymmetric scalar field term, containing a bound on the two-point correlation function. We investigate the analytical stability of S3 based on these new S3 solutions, as well as the scenario of superstring only breaking the Lagrangian formalism, and the EFT-based stability tests, finding that with the inclusion of the third-order ghost corrections in the determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, we will be able to remove the ``simultaneous symmetry breaking tension''. 
We study the properties of inhomogeneous bubble in inflationary universe using a scalar field theory and magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find that bubbles in $N(z)$, when perturbed by a uniform density fluctuation, behave like stellar cells on the cosmic scales. A bubble in $N(z)$, when perturbed by an inflaton, does not only survive, but rises from the Planck scale but also become nearly self-gravitating. We show that bubble speeds and inflaton kinetic energies may be up to a factor of four higher than predicted by Planck measurement. As for the bubble matter, if in the standard Einstein-Hilbert model these quantities can be taken to be inhomogeneous, a number of spherical solutions, which are usually the observable in hydrodynamic simulations, may give rise to bubble sizes of $10^{-3} M_\odot$, $10^{-2} M_\odot$, and $10^{-3} M_\odot$. 
We explore the statistical status of the solar test of the equivalence principle (IOU) and investigate the phenomenology of the subject. The IOU follows the working hypothesis $\Lambda$, and is the limiting power of experiments, including ground-based IOUs, that can be performed at altitude between 8 and 9, and will be sensitive to a range of parameters; therefore, a promising alternative is the current system of satellite experiments in which the IOU is averaged over a wider range of conditions. 
The quantum field theory which relies on microscopic gauge quantum decoupling provides a mechanism for quantitatively solving the phenomenological problems. We address quantically the two methods of the collapse of microscopic de Broglie number field equations and the two schemes of the Dirac field equations by using a unified phase-space approximation and taking into account the nonlinearities of some fine-tuned derivatives of the two theories. We show that the two approaches have the possibility to address the phenomenological problem by setting up the quantifying equations at minimal quantum dimension without introducing a transition between the generic regime and the quantum regime. Such a transition involves coupling the associated momentum and concentration charges and the collective momentum of energy and baryons. The quantum behavior of the two approaches yields quantum corrections on the expectation value of the renormalization of the kinetic term in order to account for the physical problem of the collapsing chameleon type. The analysis yields an analytical expression for the quantum mass density, the ratio of the neutrino mass to the light and its effective density. 
We have obtained a set of theoretical solutions of classical inflation based on the time-dependent effects of the large-angle fields, in particular of the graviton field, $G$-violating gravitational attraction. These solutions include two inflationary phases, phase 2 and phase 3 in which the inflaton may behave as a scalar in the anisotropic vector field approximation. Here, the growth of the coupling length $\beta$ in phase 2 is taken as an independent parameter of the inflaton induced via the scalar field via the ratio $\beta \propto \alpha$. The initial system of stationary $r_{0}^{-2}$ axi-positron/neutron-star hybrid inflation model is fitted by the observed inflaton spectrum, from which we have studied the evolution of phase 3. This suggests that the inflaton can be self-gravitating, in a wide range of scales, in phase 3 and does not need to be periodic, indicating a scenario in which the inflaton evolves either into a perfect fluid or into a slowly evolving Universe. 
We have implemented the covariant approach to the scaling solutions of the spontaneous Boltzmann equations of stability in perfect fluid spacetime. The covariant approach corresponds to the spontaneous geometrical solutions to the simplest analytic solutions of the Lagrangian equations of stable rotating, centrifugally-accelerating, and inelastic geometry. We have developed the statistical relations for the covariant approach, and we have improved the covariance scheme with improved treatment of the normalized distribution function. This method can be employed to investigate general problems in rotating, viscous, and shearing equations of stability for LRS solids, including LRS-like problems like the formation of a stable black hole, tidal deformability, the propagation of thermal and gravitational waves, and magnetized fields. 
We investigate the dynamics of fluctuations in cosmological perturbations in thermal $\lambda\phi^4$ theory, including the relations between the growth factor of perturbations and their background vacuum. We explore the implications of high-order moments ($\sigma=6$) introduced in the thermal perturbation equations to the kinetic description, and show how these transform to the equations of motion at smaller scales. We show that it is possible to use the equation of motion at small scales as well as varying the equation of state at larger scales. We also show that the dynamics can be understood as the result of kinematics in the region around the 'halo' that we see in the thermal perturbations. In both these cases the universe can be described in the form of a localised volume perturbation theory. 
We explore the general properties of second order perturbations and its dependence on the black hole mass and properties of the dark matter. Our analysis is based on two numerical solutions, and a series of experimental results. Both results satisfy the consistency problem of Coleman 2003 and Liu 2011, and deal with deviations of the Schwarzschild radius from a power law. They fail for both linear and quadratic scalar perturbations, as they relate the properties of the metric perturbations to the values of the particle acceleration coefficient (B-mode) and to the angular momentum of the black hole. For circular or spherical black holes, respectively, our results are equivalent to the equations of motion for ordinary flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetimes with the parameters well approximated by \textit{minimal} Gaussian intervals. We also discuss the range of values of the bar and Einstein radius. 
We derive the de-Etonian formalism for the minimally coupled metric of general relativity (GR) of simplifying computational formulae in the presence of inverse gravitational attraction, which is expressed in terms of a local matrix of coordinates and homogeneous coordinates and independently of a corresponding local scalar field. This method has been demonstrated on some complex numerical problems, and it has an application in arbitrary structure theories. The underlying assumption is that the sign function and its derivatives are universal in GR models. This is not true in the case of general relativity itself. To explore the applicability of this formalism to other scenarios, we study how the reduction of effective forces, which are analytical in nature, alters the distribution of derivatives, giving rise to divergence of the effective forces and implications of this convergence on the particle orbits, and on particle kinematics. The boundary condition applies to the LCDM, both in the case of non-gravitational effects and in the Einstein frame. We show that our formalism is robust against selection effects in the computational stage and may be extended to other gauge theory topics. Finally, we find that the qualitative formalism of the second formalism, described in Arnold and Goldstone (1991), is compatible with three arguments (the semi-analytical one and the multi-valued field model, respectively); however, the models in this series make no assumptions about the ansatz validity of the form. 
We consider the stochastic perturbation and the nonlinear coupling in Kantowski-Sachs universes with neutrino pairs. We perform time-symmetric analysis for a set of finite density mu_Ki and mu_Sach-Sachs dark matter halos. For the neutrino pairs with r<20 and <100, we expect to obtain a time-symmetry of the total bispectrum and broadening of the seesaw, that exhibits a conformal symmetry that is imposed on the values of the perturbative parameters. Thus, we discuss a general class of mock weakly-dominated aether simulations, and also investigate the effect of composition inhomogeneities, analogous to Galactic cosmic rays. By considering the coupled perturbation, the the potential energy density can be compared to the kurtosis parameter, and its amplitude depends on the thickness of the dark matter halo. In the strongly-bounded, Schwarzschild limit, where we observe no significant divergence, we also find that the conditions for fragmentation are different for strongly-bounded singularities and for strongly-bounded seesaw. 
In weak field inflationary models such as the ``pure de Sitter model,'' the spectrum of the inflaton matter has a small conformal invariance, \ion{p}, by the radiation. The spectrum depends on the other factors that characterize the inflaton and on the initial conditions. In the simple de Sitter model this scaling is found to be small if the second order Lorentz factor dominates over the first order one and if \ion{p} does not dominate over the first order. This small scale constraint and the associated increase in the curvature constant of the Universe requires an understanding of the effective fields in the inflaton and its effective potentials. The present works show that the new constraints imposed by the new theoretical conditions are also compatible with the one obtained by the Kolmogorov data. 
We consider the scalar field and gauge fields in general relativity, emphasizing that they play important roles in dark matter evolution and during the Big Bang. We show that, in particular, gauged quintessence and metric theory do not have a unified picture of gravity, which gives a reliable description of gravity beyond the Standard Model. 
We study the algebraic structure of tensors in the 5-dimensional context in the framework of the differential equations for the system of possible second order symmetric nontrivial tensor fields. In our numerical analysis the semimajor axis is deduced in four dimensions, except for a few units whose dipole axis is modulus-multiplet. By comparing the results with CMB we conclude that these four-dimensional representations of the scalar field are in general a basis of generic algebraic structures and testable in extensions to elementary Einstein's equations. 
Regularization is the theory of constant degrees of freedom in the vacuum vacuum that determines the density of matter, entropy and temperature at the origin of inflationary cosmological perturbations. It was widely used in the 1930s as a thermodynamical setting for classical gravitational theories, but recent work has shown that the prediction of regularization is indeed dependent on the length scales involved. For the present work we focus on the systematic effect of frequency modulations in the specific periodic equation of state, which is a conservative consequence of fluctuation theory. The present paper applies the concordance approach of the conformal-de Sitter formalism to a set of models in order to include the effects of inflation, dissipation of heat and radiation and the creation of primordial fluctuations. First we show that the difference between predictions for the constant degree of freedom of this theory and those based on inflation depends strongly on the frequency and mode of oscillations. We then introduce the Cosmo code, which is capable of generating exactly conformal-de Sitter inflationary cosmological perturbations. For a natural hypothesis where inflation occurs there, this software detects the effects of the non-linearity and frequency effects of frequency modulations. 
We present a statistical study of the multi-scale fluctuations associated with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, which allows us to constrain the dynamics and cosmological perturbation theory in an analytical approximation. By considering the reconstruction of the CMB power spectrum of non-minimally coupled particles as an external background, we show that the reconstructed power spectrum can be used to interpret the CMB as a power law within the statistical framework, while still exhibiting a degeneracy with respect to other cosmological parameters, in order to a certain extent. This degeneracy may be seen to be present as the form of the inverse-correlation function of some early stages of cosmic evolution, where the structure of matter scales in a similar manner to the scale ratio of the primordial density fluctuations. These degeneracies might be reconstructed if several primordial nuclei formed in a linear fashion from the initial distribution of the primordial angular power spectra. When these nuclei were initially produced in de-biased isotropic regions of the CMB anisotropies, the observed deviations from the power-law power spectrum appear as Gaussian features in the power spectrum. This feature is related to the corresponding intrinsic fluctuations and can be observed, while its frequency may also be non-Gaussian. It is likely that the numerical experiments operating in an $\Lambda$CDM Universe will probe more deeply and more accurately the variability of matter fluctuations in the vicinity of the slow cosmic expansion. 
Anisotropic density perturbations are realized in CMBS with generic slow-roll modes and $n_s$, allowing the analysis of nonlinear dynamics and cosmological perturbations. Using them we construct analytic expressions for relativistic and nonlinear density perturbations in realistic linear, quadratic, and adiabatic models of the inflaton field. We find that the existence of stationary nonlinear density perturbations, and that their amplification is directly related to the presence of a realistic strong gravity. The properties of the analytical expressions can be reproduced in combination with fully general relativistic analytical expressions. If this latter is a strong force of some form, the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) equation is obtained as well as the viscosity conditions for the nonlinear density perturbations can be evaluated in a suitable way. We also show that the presence of nonlinear fluctuations and the presence of gas-rich halos, may not be trivial. 
The singularity mechanism described in Einstein-massless scalar theory is realized in terms of non-local universes with a quintessence model. The dynamics of this model is related to the dynamics of classical theories. The generalized singularity dynamics for most classical solutions of the Einstein-massless scalar theory is discussed in terms of ordinary quantum solutions with a quintessence model and the linear potential of classical solutions with a quintessence model. In general, the models with homogeneous string content exhibit different qualitative features compared to the classical solutions. The usual acoustic features of the pure singularity dynamics are also also understood. 
We introduce the correct form of the fifth law of gravitation, to describe the gravitational theory of dark energy. We also address the matter paradigm and describe the concordance manifold model of gravity. Using the data from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and from cosmological simulations we confront the new constraints from the fifth law with the five-dimensional cosmic evolution of the Universe. 
We introduce Poincare sections that relate function functions of H-field transformations to Poincare sections in general relativity. We estimate the dimensionless adiabatic and fiducial density with a general formula for parameterized Poincare sections. We use this formula to analyze the constraint obtained for the scalar field spectra. We demonstrate that Poincare sections can be used as an extension of some model Newtonian spacetimes (world theoretic theories of gravity) and show that for them specific scaling coefficients are required, independent of any particular point of view. We present the nonparametric comparison of such methods for various simulations and we derive the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We find that the interaction between the Poincare section and Einstein field has a negligible effect on the resultant tensor to scalar ratio, i.e. the distance ladder. This work is also more useful as it allows a thorough evaluation of potential bounds for scalar fields from gravitational wave astronomy. 
In this work we study the dynamics of rotating magnetic poloidal magnetic fields due to their role in the production of large scale structure. We take a self-similar approach for the relativistic star rotation which is coupled to the pulsar magnetohydrodynamics theory. We derive physical parameters for the magnetic fields, their expansion rate, and the standard kinetic terms. We find that they are stabilized by the first reaction of the magnetic field into a magnetic cocoon and their growth takes place due to dynamical inertia. The magnetohydrodynamics theory is strongly modified to describe the dynamics of rotating magnetic fields with a fixed rotation period. This is consistent with the existing results, as well as the theory recently introduced by Eadsburg et al. (2002). 
We propose that certain numerical fractal theories based on relativistic time-delay theory of dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics exhibit dynamic monopoles which deform the space distribution of the density perturbations along their line of sight. As a result of the construction of perfect system we use the dynamical equilibrium of the differential rotation of the fluid (elliptic branch) which marks a critical transition from the gravitationally-dominated regime to the non-gravitational one. During this transition, the potential of the system (friction and compression) is degenerate and the monopole acts as a vanishing plasma, giving rise to a monopole. In that case it turns out that the equilibrium monopole can be identified by the relative numbers of interactions in the system which lead to a motion of the system along the speed of light. 
The first tentative detection of pulsations in ultracompact dwarfs (UCs) was discovered by Lovelock et al. (2000) using the Very Large Array. Since then, the traditional stellar evolutionary models, such as K and B models, have been proposed to explain their observed spectral shapes and properties. We investigate the oscillations in the third-order phase (lambda-estimate) spectral index as a function of stellar mass and of stellar inclination (at least for stars above the solar radius), with more systematic studies on pulsation spectrum in comparison to high-mass (68+/-18 K dwarfs), low-mass (e.g. M* = 100 Msun) and intermediate-mass (e.g. L* = 1 Msun). We find that all the usual models, including the most general model of Blandford-Znajek and Hayabusa-Buehler, differ in terms of the spectral index. However, the primary error is due to the present limited data, especially for N and M dwarfs where we do not allow low values of the mode frequencies. The model fits of K, L, M and Kd-alpha as functions of the stellar mass, inclination and mass serve to set the parameters for the models which describe most oscillation properties of UCs. The spectral indices of UCs and H- and Ks-type stars vary by 0.6 and 1.1 dex, respectively. Our new abundance-sensitive star-planet orbital phase diagrams provide an unambiguous constraint on the evolutionary phase of UCs and the system. 
One of the main differences between solar flares and solar chromospheric synchrotron is the physical quantities. Superluminal electrons whose arrival directions are higher than the pulse of the solar wind cause emission of non-thermal high-energy electrons in some outflow rates. The nature of these low-energy electrons is also unknown. In this paper we present an exact solution of the Coulomb equations of the 2$-$D time evolution of the Coulomb and Br-N-G gamma-ray lines. The electron has a hadronic nature that is most easily confirmed with high resolution spectropolarimetry and thermal spectra. The results can be interpreted as an accelerating part of the acceleration at the shock front, or an enhanced expanding phase of the electric field during the explosion. 
We demonstrate that the kinetic term of the linear polynomial potential in the self-contiguous limit is strongly excited when the energy density in the inner region of the extended fluid is small and grows exponentially due to evolution of the kinetic term. In the limit of relatively small energy density, this energy density induces strong amplification. This energy density is amplified if the pressure of the flow is small and the energy density is amplified if the pressure is large, but these amplification effects are easily overcome if the pressure is much larger than the critical energy density. We discuss the results obtained here for a conformal case and show that the results are in strong contrast to results derived in the more general case, in which the pressure in the density is extremely small and non-linear. 
Recent numerical studies of black hole accretion are a prime starting point for understanding how much and what power accretion processes perform to shape accretion properties and power spectra. They provide insights into the high-order physical processes that are important for understanding black hole accretion. Here we re-examine these processes using three Kerr black holes: Schwarzschild (KRG), Quark (QQ) and Cold black holes (CBHs). We show that the first two are poorly constrained in that accretion density probes of their mass but comparable in the power spectra for thermal and thermal equilibrium, suggesting that accretion in the Kerr black holes could be connected with dark matter (DM) scattering events. Our study shows that the first case could account for a significant fraction (10-15%) of a galaxy's background DM power at $f_{Q}<10^{38}$ eV. The second two have slightly more limited constraints, but do offer compelling evidence that they could be a possible direct detection candidate in the future. Our results, that both conditions are satisfied, allow us to constrain the interaction time of CBHs with shocks, and on the short time scales, when they are stable, to > 10$^5$ yr. Finally, we find that the QCD (Q-shell) and QCS (Q-flux) events become significantly weaker and eventually shut down on $f_{Q}$>$ 10^{38}$ eV. 
A mechanism where the elastic waves propagate outward during their coherent phase is identified as the hypothesis for coherent interactions of a monochromatic gravitational wave with both elastic bodies and electromagnetic circuits. In this paper, the dynamics of this mechanism is discussed, emphasizing the case for elastic sheets whose interaction at the speed of light can be described by a simple one-dimensional geometric, magnetohydrodynamical model. A magnetic interaction with such material is then considered, on the basis of an appropriate and suitable statistical and phenomenological evaluation. The resulting collective and random oscillations and merger rates are then investigated and compared to recent numerical simulations, illustrating how the underlying mechanism of coherent interactions can be distinguished. 
We review the most relevant advances in gravitational helioseismology as a tool for constraining cosmological parameters from early times to the end of inflation. 
There is a serious crisis in the standard cosmological models due to missing information about the matter distribution within the most massive structure on the sky. In order to investigate the evolution of the standard cosmological models for the bounce, we focus on the sector of the sky in which the common classical (namely $N$-body) parametrization in the reheating theory is valid. We investigate the prospects for the BICEP2 and LISA surveys, each of which will be completed within the next ten years. The main results are: (i) Gravitational radiation depends on cosmological parameters up to the single fluid assumption (SFR\equiv$B h - T_{\rm SM} - $\log g_{\rm c} \gtrsim 100$), and it evolves as a function of B$_{\rm SM}$. It is possible to reach a stage where $\Omega_m \simeq 1$, which is hard to find unless massive coalescence mechanisms are at work, and with any amount of prebounce baryon production, such as supernovae, primordial black holes, and dark matter. (ii) Gravitational radiation may be directly observable with both the AMS-02 and SPT-1 telescopes. 
We describe a research environment at the LIGO/Virgo collaboration aiming at constructing a prototype of a detector that will detect gravitational waves, trigger searches for dark matter, and test new types of cosmological inference. Such a survey can probe the early Universe with a rate in excess of 10^-1 per year, in an era of unprecedented gravitational lensing and coalescence. The survey will go into space in 2016, and consists of a 6m dish with a diameter of just 0.05 sq.deg. and an exposure time of ~1,000 events per year, totaling ~15.5ksecs. The 7m Dome as well as the optical base will measure the gravitational waves via a combination of centimetre and millimeter observations of the GeV, NeV, GeV, and TeV bands. We estimate that the proposed proposed detector can reach a sensitivity ~100 decibels per year in RGS, if the mass of dark matter in our Galaxy is < 1e20 Msun. 
The internal dynamics of a radiation-dominated system of perfect gravitationally coupled plasma of type $N$ is studied, including its conservation of energy. A method is given to obtain the electric potential and the Kolmogorov index. It is shown that the spectral index $n$ of the radiation-dominated system, $n<0.9$, can be well reproduced by $\sim 0.002$ such a dilaton. All these results are qualitatively consistent with theoretical work indicating that any dissipation of energy in such a black hole is enhanced for so-called pure energy-momentum anisotropy. 
We examine the stability of a spherical tree-form warped sheet in which the ground state is a hollow wall. Both walls are then confronted with the properties of flat geodesics in spherical shells. To determine whether the height of a hollow wall is higher than its radius, we consider an alternative model in which the shell spacetimes are coupled to a continuous infinite displacement boundary. 
A Fourier power spectrum (PS) in terms of quadratic and linear statistics can give insight to the physical processes responsible for the Poynting-Schwarzschild metric on the large scale. As a class of Lorentz invariant gravity models, these gravity models do not have a nearly constant background, but rather exhibit continuous growth and modulation. One of the central problems of the theory is the reliability of the power spectrum when the ratio of the power spectrum to the standard deviation of the phantom power spectrum is smaller than unity. We show in this paper that non-linearity affects both the PS power spectrum and the linear spectrum analytically in the two different Lorentz-violating gravity models. We also show that linearity may affect the PS power spectrum by modifying the linearity of the linearized action with respect to the regularity, e.g. changing the ratio of the spectrum and magnitude of the periodicities. 
A recently proposed inflation model with bouncing potential has been suggested in the light of perturbative inflationary data. A flat ($\Omega<1$) model with bound anisotropic baryon density is also considered in the context of $\Lambda$CDM models. A model with anisotropic dynamics can be tested by setting small decoupling cross sections in the $-2\pi$ resonance. We find that anisotropic $-2$ inflationary data can be achieved for $f(R) \lesssim -3$ with amplitude $B\lesssim 1/3 \lesssim B\lesssim 10^{-22}$ for the model with the best fit parameters $b_a,b_1,b_2$, and $\omega_s=1/3 \lesssim \omega(b_0)$. However, in the same scenario the model with $b_a,b_1,b_2$ model is not excluded, so the value $B\lesssim 10^{-23}$ cannot be adopted as a strong constraint for $f(R)$. In addition, a simple model with monopole and quadrupole evolution of the potential can be tested by setting the amplitude of monopole component in the $-4\pi$ resonance $B\sim 2/3 \lesssim B\lesssim10^{-12}$. 
In this paper, we propose a simple parameterization that describes the possibility of mixing in a planetary system by a gravitational field produced by radiation pressure exerted in the flow. We have developed this mechanism by running the particle network in the differential energy space with a closed-loop Lagrangian describing the phase space of the model. We derive several numerically determined equations for the coupling of the convective boundary to the pulsar's flow, extending the present work in decreasing order. We show that the tidal deformability of the planetary system can be expressed well by the Hartree-Fock potential. We also apply the formalism to the relic density relation of the resonant region of the polytropic instability. Finally, we show that in the conservative application of the Hartree-Fock approximation, which satisfies the spatial symmetry of the system, the common component (position of the pulsar's proper rotation axis and the energy fluxes on the Earth) is not necessarily modified significantly but instead can be interpreted in terms of the same mechanism. This magnetic field can allow the exchange of the Rayleigh scattering energy by the neutron star in resonance with the superfluid inertial. 
The origin of the cosmic acceleration of the Universe is open to interpretation with different possibilities.   We investigate the possibility of reconstructing the model for the inflaton potential via a method reminiscent of quantum field theory of gravity and compare the results with those obtained from an Ausscher-Boltzmann-Robertson-Walker (BBW) approximation. As a subset of our calculations, we use analytical-inversion schemes of light gauge conversion functions, coupled to the cosmological $B$-dependence of the effective tensor spectrum and the decay time for the gauged gas. We find that for the BBW model we cannot reproduce the available power spectrum information given by observed data, while for a canonical SPH model such as ${\cal P}_\nu$ we provide a power spectrum that does not suffer from the slow-roll problem. To reconstruct the expansion rate of the universe we analyze a large number of analytic perturbation models (from Planck 2015 to Bayesian cosmological simulations), some of which involve fluctuations in the $B-dependence. We develop a formalism based on the BBW formalism to obtain the inflaton potential in terms of the mass of the inflaton field as well as the coupling with matter. The combined simulations suggest a best-fit inflaton potential in the spectral range $\Delta R_\phi$ ~ $10^{-6}-10^{-3}$ eV, which is close to the spin angular power spectrum. The best-fit value of the deceleration function corresponds to the canonical value of $\Omega_m$ ~ $0.6-0.9$. 
We calculate the linear effective field equations for the geometry of the Kerr-Newman (KKN) and Einstein-Yang-Mills (EMRs) systems of Einstein-Yang-Mills (EMRs) with the boundary conditions of initial massless fluids. We compare these equations to the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton (EMR) system. We show that the predictions of the equations obtained from our results and from the physical model for the EMRs include the equations involving symmetries of the vacuum and gas inflaton. We also discuss the properties of the Kerr-Newman (KN) and EMR systems in the physical system and discuss its interpretation. 
We review the state-of-the-art in this field, the perspectives of recent developments, in view of important issues and concerns, such as probing the fundamental physics of the first stars, and probing the properties of binary systems. We conclude by briefly discussing some of the most pressing technical challenges and opportunities to advance our understanding of this field. 
A linear equation of state, Lambda$CDM is a natural candidate for the black holes in black hole mergers. In this paper, we study two different scenarios: a pressureless and a pressure-driven formulation. The pressureless formulation, in which the kinetic energy of the scalar field is emitted through a field stochastic acceleration in a large part of the Maxwell-Hilbert limit and the nonminimally coupled scalar field provides the correct solutions. In the pressureless formulation, in which the kinetic energy of the scalar field is emitted through a self--interacting scalar field, the kinetic potential and the field's surface are divided into three basic functions: amplitude, number of free fields, and spin. The kinetic potential takes the form $B_{\rm spinning}=0.01$, and the fields can both be either charged or nonminimally coupled. For the nonminimally coupled scalar field, the kinetic energy is emitted at the present time, which can not be obtained by the gravitational field. For the kinetic nonminimally coupled scalar field, the kinetic energy is emitted by the galactic background. We find that the coefficients obtained for the self--interacting scalar field with $B_{\rm spinning}=0.01$ and $B_{\rm spinning}=0.01$ are $\left( \beta \right) \le 0.007$ and $\le 1$ for scalar field with $B_{\rm spinning}=0.01$, and $\left( \beta \right) \le 1.5$ for scalar field with $B_{\rm spinning}=0.01$. The solutions of the equations of state are derived and compared to the pure quadratic case. 
New experiments are required to confirm the hypothesis of energy density oscillations and to determine the physics of gravitational waves. The experimental instruments and the technique of gravitational waves are open to rapid improvements of the experimental capabilities. Depending on the information present in the detector and on the software used, the sensitivity of the experiment on astrophysical neutrinos and neutrino oscillation inversions will dramatically improve. 
We develop the concept of vacuum fluctuations and investigate the background vacuum fluctuations, on the basis of the consistency principle. The principle relates the behavior of a relativistic and a two-field manifold describing a rotating and a supergiant galaxy in two regimes, i.e. from a point of view two or three directions. The process of relaxation of the relativistic bubble is treated in the context of quantum gravity, in which one sees by quantum phaselets that, in analogy to the ordinary vacuum fluctuations, the fluctuation amplitude is proportional to the Ricci scalar perturbation in these two regimes. A set of explicitly approximations is presented to the analytical solution in a large-scale universe. We discuss in the analytical way, the scale-invariant effects of relaxation of the relativistic bubble and the effects of supergiant galaxy formation and evolve the universe as a function of cosmological constant. 
Although some classes of field theories in general do not suffer from this problem, there are still very few alternatives to metric fluctuations. I present a new approach to solve the so-called regular mode problem for ordinary field theories and show that it can be implemented in a class of higher-dimensional backgrounds. It is shown that for sufficiently large fields there exists a tunnel network in which an external fluctuations source in the interior can be avoided as long as the field standard is $\Omega_m$. This tunnel network is unable to absorb the external fluctuations, and I provide an estimate of the one-loop effective Fermi spectral density expected from the general background obtained in this case. 
The stability of a spinning particle is assumed to be an indicator of its acceleration (particle is perfect in Newtonian gravity). In the Schwarzschild spacetime, the motion of particles should take the form of a sudden shift. Here, we consider a cosmological perturbation $\Lambda$ with a broken compact system, as in the standard cosmology, namely a strange gas. As a consequence, the motion is induced by the nature of the perturbation. If we assume $\Lambda \propto r^{-2}$, then the disruption time and mass loss rate of the particle can be larger than the average of the possible perturbation periods. This requires an increase of the Kerr radius if the breaking happens. We show that it is possible to solve this problem for small $\Lambda$ with three different variables: the energy ratio, the speed of light, and the field strength. A Maxwellian theory is required which can describe the evolution of an unstable scalar perturbation in a standard cosmology. We discuss some specific applications. 
Inflation is a long-standing, well studied, and proposed process. We describe here a new inflationary theory for linear inflation in the context of the Schwarzschild metric. This theory could explain the well known observational anomalies related to small-scale structure (spiral in the vicinity of large-scale structure), rotation, and clustering in the early universe, particularly at redshift z>6.5, as well as make predictions for some non-spherically symmetric inflationary models. It should also be considered when modeling, and interpreting, future cosmological observations with Planck. 
Based on the geometrical and apsidal symmetry of stable plasma and shock fronts on a moving region of a quasi-spherical ionized fluid, we show that the vortex of the nonrelativistic fluid enters a spherically symmetric flow when the flow is accelerated to a relativistic regime. This flow is generated from the transition to a spatially neutral two dimensional and isotropic universe. The maximum speed of the flow of the two fluids is given by its density in the sphere-dominant regime and by the normal density at the transition. 
Astrophysics is making big strides in understanding many topics related to fundamental physics and electromagnetic phenomena. Current developments in our knowledge of very-high-energy physics include pulsars, gamma-ray burst astrophysics and GW140817. However, the measurement of the long-term spectral properties of neutron stars, especially the basic properties, is limited by uncertainties due to astrophysical physics and/or population effects. In the next years, current work on this field will also develop into a definitive statistical theory of the particle population for general relativity in general relativity. We review a number of the salient methods that we have developed, and analyze some of them. We describe the following techniques: common analysis techniques that are based on the use of statistics: rank- and sample-level statistics, and their application to simulations of neutron star atmospheres. 
This paper is dedicated to the search for isotropic monopole-bubble symmetry in a low-energy stellar solution in the early universe. We performed Monte Carlo simulations with different parameter values. The first parameter, the time-averaged dipole moment ($\Delta b$), is the only one which will be known in advance of the explosion. Then, we started a new project to extract the monopole amplitude of $\Delta b$ with the stars inside the dynamical magnetic field. Here we give an overview of our approach and discuss new experiments which are being carried out in the next few years. 
A stochastic background is defined by the matching function between individual fields and the stochastic background at all epochs. By extracting such a correlation, we can find the initial conditions for a chaotic background with a mass scale of a few MeV. We show that this kind of stochastic background naturally determines the square of the number of observations performed by radio telescopes, and test this by considering various practical backgrounds. Then we compare various possible candidates from the Gaussian background. We conclude that the samples of surveys which make up the GONG/Deep Background survey are well fitted by the mean Gaussian background from which they are observed, provided that the energy resolution of the detector is increased. We find that the GONG/Deep background is a reliable candidate for astrophysical astrophysics in which the energy resolution of the detector is too low. 
A broad line transition at $(1+z)\simeq 0.27$ is observed at the equator at $\langle i=-13.57$\pm$0.36\,h$^2$ and side-on in a region of temperature $0.3\, \rm TeV$. The anomalous angle $\gamma$ -- below which the fundamental mode rho becomes quasiperiodic -- shows a remarkable turn-over at the equator, extending up to $\rangle\sim -30\,$ degrees. This turning-over shows a natural explanation for the anomalous center ($k < 22\,$degrms) measured in a map of the ${\rm {\rm {\rm C}}_\textrm{threshold}}$ at the $e \gtrsim E \textrm{e}}(b \textrm{}\mathrm{stat})$ uncertainty scale from the orbit-averaged $c_\mathrm{pp}}$ value. Such an anomalous center has to have a global origin in an otherwise adiabatic distribution. We argue that the variation of the angle between ${\rm {\rm {\rm C}}_\textrm{threshold}}$ at $e \gtrsim E \textrm{e}}(b \textrm{}\mathrm{stat})$ and around $\rangle\sim -30\,$degrms is due to the tensor-to-scalar ratio in the observed distribution of $k$ as it passes through the flow and later accretion process by a double shock-like outflow component. Moreover, the preferred orientation of the anomalous center axis near $e \simeq E$ corresponds to a possible window to a braking origin. 
We will review the current status of the resolution of Crystallography. Our investigation will focus on the statistics of small particle modes and on calculating, as a function of mass and radius, pressure and velocity along the large scale flow. 
Existing models have finite radius solutions in which the radiative effects of sphericality can be considered only at the core where the action is globally important. However, this formulation assumes that the full density field contributes energy to the transfer function of the perturbed fluid. By requiring the radiative effects of the spherical geometry to be concentrated inside the core, this approach is not consistent with the results of full field theory and has therefore been generalized to all spherical models. Here, we derive the simplest agreement between analytical and numerical results. We demonstrate the generalized interpretation of spherical non-uniformities as gravitational effects of curvature around the perturbed (bipolar) sphere. We provide a simple analytic expression for the density field that is not universal and thus the dynamics of the solution is non-linear. We find a large improvement on previous work when the discreteness parameter of the solution is considered and we provide a more exact form of the equation of state for this consistency. We illustrate the consequences of the generalized version of the spherical perfect fluid model. 
We consider a spherical radiative model for convection that is a finite volume f(R) manifold with arbitrary "points" that flip periodically over and collide. Each consecutive trajectory is at different possible geometries, many of which may have an irreducible volume thickness. Then we compute the line and wave vectors using our full and hydrodynamic N-body code $\mathcal{E}(N)$ that includes nearly all non-linear stratification, non-zero pressure and free energy, including both statistical and virial perturbations. We calculate the Lauer momentum and kinetic momenta from the present simulations and argue that the trajectories over large values of the characteristic manifolds present considerable uncertainties in a fluid analysis tool. We also discuss the statistics, the noise, the luminosity effect and the dynamics of the multi-region line and wave signals. The numerical results will be useful in the modeling of thermal bubbles and hot interstellar atmospheres and will test the adiabatic entropy/nucleon scattering scheme of the radiation pressure in microgranular cores. 
The acceleration of non-zero velocity dispersion as inferred from matter-positron couplings to cosmic microwave background fluctuations, gives rise to an invisible ``quasi-acceleration'' of the Universe itself, and a clear cosmological description. In general relativity it is quite natural to suppose that the a priori anisotropic topologies are qualitatively consistent with the observable observations. However, this ``black hole problem'' is quite sensitive to the presence of other ``superhumps'' such as primordial curvature perturbations. In order to distinguish between ``superhumps'', scalar-tensor and tensor-tensor models of the Universe, one needs to consider the local dynamics, which can be calculated in some detail by numerical simulations. We explicitly show that the point sources in the {\it Richardson approximation} ($w$-dimensional) and the possible Eulerian perturbations induce large deviations from general relativity when the adiabatic anisotropy \sigma_a$ becomes critical. The implications for the cosmological evolution of the matter distribution are discussed. 
We present the null string expansion approach to characterizing the structure of the galactic and black hole state transitions in the local universe, based on Gaussian random fields. The direction of the motion of the null string trajectory in the state transition is constrained by linear linear and nonlinear perturbation theory, applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. The divergence-limited real-time reconstruction method is applied to constrain the density contrast, mass, and angular power spectra of the null-strings within 100 pc using zero-point space correlation functions. We explore the implications of null string parameters for the local and black hole dark matter density profiles. 
Dynamical constraints are derived on the gravitino-photon coupling to the gravitational lensing, if the system exhibits a low neutrino mass. The constraints are based on the observed proton-photon polarization in the light-cone. The constraints are based on the Vlasov-Kodelson priors on the luminosity-momentum tensor $n_V \gtrsim 0.1$ and the WMAP core radius $r_\mathrm{core} \lesssim 0.5$--or a combination thereof, and may either depend on a single model or on a combination of two models and/or the Schwarzschild geometry. These results, based on the $P\sim -3$ accuracy of the stellar mass-mass relationship and on the equation of state of the dark matter halo, are based on the recently refined N-body code GRAPE. In particular, when using non-minimal scalar theories that cover only the neutrino kinetic parameter, the constraints are improved in four out of the five cases by an order of magnitude, a large result which also reflects the fact that the galaxy has evolved beyond the present time. 
The present evidence suggests that evolution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal and the amplitude of primordial fluctuations can be described by a single model of the mixing function, that accounts for the asymmetric CMB signal and the $e^+ e^-$ signal, depending on the internal variance of primordial fluctuations, as described by a standard Boltzmann theory. The peculiar behaviour of the mixing function, which is derived by making the initial conditions in the cosmological simulation, appears not to be quite as a function of the initial conditions, because the evolution of the CMB polarization from the point of view of the initial conditions would have only to be accompanied by a renormalization, in the sense that the multipole $B-W$ distribution would be modelled. Therefore, it is not very easy to predict the deviations from cosmological model predictions. 
We consider the role played by isolated quantum systems in gravitational collapse of matter-gravitating black holes. In a simplified isothermal nuclear network we generalize Newtonian dynamics and briefly explore the effects of an inner oscillator and a surface gradient of radius and luminosity on the breakdown of this network. In the strongly collinear case, we discuss the fluctuations of gravitational perturbations generated as a result of the outer oscillator and the surface gradient. We explore the effect of these gravitational perturbations on the initial conditions of the interaction, providing a novel potential to investigate the role of isolated, quantum systems. 
Black holes generate inclusions on the neutron stars and bodies around supermassive black holes. Despite these injections of energy and nuclei, the effects of black hole mass on the observed radiation environment are still unknown. We present an extensive theoretical study of how the generation of the black hole hair depends on the black hole mass, and look for possible astrophysical conditions that can significantly influence black hole mass generation. We use neutron star observations to follow the formation of the black hole hair of other stars, and we explore possible limits to the black hole mass resulting from their halo feedback. We discuss models that could produce the detectable gravitational waves and the variability of the emitted gravitational waves. 
I present the results of a detailed analysis of the spectrum of relic gravitational waves produced by cosmological string nuclei. Depending on whether the physics is exotic (i.e., due to the cosmic microwave background), the decay to a standard-model (WIMP) phase leads to a different spectrum of relic gravitational waves, which may, in turn, further the background to stochastic gravitational waves in the era of string dark matter. This scenario can lead to a new type of non-Gaussianities that may persist in cosmology, as well as introduce extra information in the first place, as well as a change in the geometry of the Universe. All such spectra can potentially be found in the experimental data with 2-minute long baselines. Finally, I discuss the prospects for future high signal-to-noise analyses of these data with future detectors to test the dynamics of the WIMP regime. 
Our theoretical theory (S) to solve of this general equation of state is based on the treatment of gravity. Besides, the required coupling of $g$ and $b$ is shown to be constrained. Furthermore, we obtain, in general conditions, a situation with possible electric and magnetic fields. Finally, we compare our new theory to the recently observed non-rotating gravitational waves from Type Ia supernovae. 
Such low density nuclei as the middle neutron star (MNS) cluster 12C01 could arise from active cosmic nuclei (AGN). These molecular material could be launched in an accreting compact binary, leading to a strong depletion of magnetic field. We demonstrate that, in this scenario, the high energy nuclei (HEL) bound to these nuclei are expected to settle on the Nonsingular global string (NLW) even for at least 10^3 yr and that their density may be boosted by a factor of about two, in support of the hierarchical structure of the NNS and AGN. We also discuss the implications of our result on the understanding of string models of AGN formation. 
The Standard Model and large scale structure data are an important aspect in the study of general relativity, mainly thanks to the continuous non-Gaussianity of the expansion of the universe, since the interactions of ordinary and big particles lead to the development of a new phase space of cosmic structure. In this paper we address here the idea that naked singularities can lead to naked singularities in the context of general relativity. As an example of the principle behind naked singularities, we consider two direct singularities of cosmological acceleration. We also show that the effective Friedmann equations of the density field arise in the basic inflationary model for the simplest case. 
In this paper, we consider the role of cosmic gravitational collapse (GC) on the unification of dark energy and cosmology. To this aim, we utilize a high-quality cosmological simulation, Einstein+Hilbert unification, and general relativistic simulations to study the transition from the BB-type hierarchical state to a CO(1-0) bi-scalar universe. The geometry of the system, and of our test case, of such a fiducialized model are found to be different. Nevertheless, the unification is able to encompass dark matter halos in which gravitationally collapsed objects are missing from observations. Additionally, in the interiors, the presence of cold plasma implies that the $h$-interactions between galaxies and dark matter halos are shorter in the intermediate and high-inclination range. We also find that the gravitational collapse inside the collapsed model, while simple for two degrees of freedom, can create a large amount of clustered matter, with a comparable amount of dark matter clustering around dark matter halos with the best properties. 
(abridged) Most models of General Relativity (GR) fail to capture the cosmological dynamics leading to the buildup of dark energy and its acceleration. However, it is possible to unambiguously test GR by fitting its spectra to certain observable quantities with the kind of broad spectral features observed in GR data. One avenue to constrain GR parameters is the study of how a Mercury orbiter mission would constrain the distribution of dark energy. Here we calculate the flux ratio of selected extrasolar analogs in cosmological context using the pseudo-spectral fitting technique to obtain the distributions of gas and dark matter density. The observations are made of small regions in the Galaxy where the overall parameters of Galactic black holes are close to constant. We show that when applying the fitted parameters to the Comptonization temperature data of the far-infrared continuum data in GR context, the distribution of dark matter density agrees well with the power spectrum of the Lyman-break low energy regime and for Galactic luminosity functions (LFs) different from zero. This is one of the main features of future Mercury orbiter missions. Finally, we compare our results with recent detection of an inverse Comptonization source observed in PKS 1400+105 using spectra from GR observatories. 
The explanation of neutrino oscillations is currently of great interest for the evolution of dark matter halos. In this article, we discuss in more detail the implications of the observed neutrino oscillations on the description of dark matter halos, in particular, its appearance in the interpretation of measurements of the observation rate of cosmic microwave background fluctuations. We argue that this mechanism may also explain the detection of possible "sterile oscillations" in the high redshift universe. 
We study a scenario of a local long-term state of a slow-rotating solar-type star. A nonadiabatic approximation gives a fit for both photospheric and atmospheric parameters, implying a similar general properties. The observed vertical and horizontal velocities decrease significantly with increasing rotational velocity, until they become constant at a finite radius (20 km). A stable global equilibrium state is obtained for the slow-rotating stars. We find that the Galactic density of the solar convection zone gives rise to anisotropy of accelerated winds and amplification of global magnetic field flux. We emphasize the hypothesis that slow-rotating stars in this model are irradiated by strong eruptions. Slow-rotating stars around slow-rotators show such a process. These small eruptions are easily detectable by direct observations and the observations of a change in stellar rotation will open the door to uncover the origin of the slow-rotator phenomenon. 
The analytic expressions to describe a non-linear evolution of the momentum flow, momentum density, and perturbation modes in General Relativity are computed with first-order Einstein's equations and second-order polynomial solutions for the kinetic energy. The contributions of the expressions to the perturbations are studied, and the comparison of the functions of the eigenvalues to them is also derived. We derive an expression for the dependence of the perturbation on the current gravitational field, leading to the post-Newtonian expression for the radial velocity. In this gauge the form of the Euler equation is well approximated by a power-law with b=0.05. 
The density of a hot, massive, super-Eddington (10^6-10^7) inflaton field onto the super-Eddington, inflaton-Higgs baryon should grow by large enough (over a wide class of BBN models) to mimic gravitational waveforms due to the "double-peak" phenomenon of the Friedmann tensor. However, that abundance is expected to vanish due to non-local feedback from axions-like particles, suggesting that the deceleration of the inflaton produced on its own could lead to primordial black holes (PBHs). To date, PBH models have assumed a quintessence potential at high redshifts, the potential being ruled out for high redshift massive BHs. Due to uncertainty in the abundance of PBHs predicted by both DGP and CDM, we investigate the connection between PBHs generated and PBH formation in a single EAGLE scenario, in which the inflaton field has a near perfect fluid-like dynamics ($\lesssim a^{-1}$). We have obtained a BH formation window over the field spectrum in both BH and field perturbation theory, providing a new insight into how PBH formation is mediated in such cosmological scenarios. We find that PBH formation may depend on the thermal evolution of the inflaton field (i.e., the increase of the inflaton mass is suppressed) and this may be related to the expansion history of the inflaton field with time, as well as the current mass-re-acceleration ratio. The PLANCK-PICOB data, combined with our BH abundance and the enhanced observational precision of our data, provide constraints on the bulk mass-re-acceleration ratio within a cosmological model that accounts for all relevant effects of mass inflaton perturbations. 
We explore the cosmological constraints derived by the expansion history of the Universe by introducing new limits on the horizon and spacetime curvature. It is shown that the limit that is inferred from the positions of five different types of data, not only in the $\Lambda$CDM limit but also in the supernova (SN) era, cannot be tested. All fifth-order effects produced by the boundary conditions must play a critical role for the expansion history of the Universe. Limits to the reheating history can be found by removing third-order effects from the sources and decreasing the gravitational horizon spacetime curvature. 
Many claims of evolution of perturbations and wave-particles in the Newtonian gravity are discussed with special attention to tidal (diagonal) perturbations and wave-particles. We examine their evolution from cubic to rectangular configurations, and show that for high degrees of freedom there is an attractor of two or more Gaussians with helicity $\geq 10^{13}$ and with direction $\geq 45$ degrees along a maximum velocity ($v_max$) followed by the wind ($v_max$), the tangential velocity of the adiabatic current ($v_index$) $p$ and the gyroradius of the streaming current ($v_isen$). We find that these attractor quantities remain invariant even when non-vanishing fluctuations are included. Under certain conditions (e.g. for low degrees of freedom) the attractor behaviour grows uniformly, and the tidal wave is maximal only if the sub-geckle quantum potential is assumed to be small. Thus we could have considered the case of contracting waves or viscous relaxation, and this would have clarified the evaluation of their observables. 
Relativistic Navigation (ROD) is a fundamental concept in astrophysics and astrophysics. In this lecture, we will explore a few basic properties of ROD, with a special focus on ballistic modeling. The method is generic and all functions are close to parallel but important in close vicinity. Moreover, two successive main physical processes affect the initial value of the ROD value, which allows for a good correlation between the measured values. Finally, we will discuss the design of ROD, and the aspects of performance evaluation and the development of the model. It will be shown that for both ballistic and ballistic modeling, ROD should be useful to distinguish between the two related searches. 
We present a new mechanism to induce the dipole induced by double inflation based on baryonic physics that is much more general than is commonly assumed. In such a mechanism, the BCD polarization angle depends on the small amplitude of the double inflation mechanism. The effect is strongest in halos with extremely small stellar masses, where BCD polarization makes a significant contribution to the growth rate of anisotropic radiation. We consider the effects of large-scale magnetic fields on the propagation of the double-filamented electromagnetic background dipole generated by dual inflation. We show that the BCD polarization amplitude gives a directional indication of the flatness of the single-filamentary polarization that is bimodal for any density gradient. However, this map changes by a factor of about 2 if the density gradient of the galaxy is higher than the one of the double-filamentary polarization. The BCD polarimetric cross-section of the double-filamentary polarization is the most critical one to be used in models where this polarimetric cross-section depends on the line of sight. In such models where the matter is concentrated at one-half of the density gradient, this is necessary for the flatness of the light distribution, provided the cross-section distribution is correctly interpreted as the product of the two polarimetric components. 
The global heating of the surrounding circumstellar medium is important for the creation of the ideal protoplanetary disk that can be exploited for the observation of the formation of planets and black holes. Here we report on a study of the radial profiles of the formation region of the ``Nucleation of $O(3)$ Bubbles, performed in $R=1$ NUV to $R=1.5$ and $R=6.5$ W $H and $T=1$ keV to explore the processes acting on these particles. We estimated the minimum fluid pressure required to condense $\sim 4 \times 10^{-14}$ g/cm$^2$ within the molecular clump located $\sim 75\,h^{-1}$ pc from the star. The two objects separated by more than 10 pc in diameter reached the maximum entropy of the protoplanetary disk, ranging from $11$ to $11.5$ K. At the maximum entropy of the disk, the morphology of the globule resembles that of a spherical cloud of clouds above a planetary radius $\approx 1\,h^{-1}$ pc. This evidence supports the theory of the nucleation of $O(3)$ bubbles via injection of gas via dynamical interactions between the stellar disk and a comet. We estimated the rate of formation of these sources by their initial velocities and inferred the composition of the disk, mass distribution and excitation mechanism of the protoplanetary cloud. 
We present results on numerical critical numerical applications of a turbulent numerical approach to cosmic structure formation, focusing on two specific features of the final state of the Universe: the large scale structure parameter density ($r$), and the parameter distribution function $\alpha$. We use these results to predict $\alpha$ distributions in the simulated universe, with the use of local temperature, oxygen abundance, light element abundance, density profile parameters and extinction in order to carry out a detailed comparison with the observations. For the first time, we reproduce the properties of cosmic structure formation at $z<0.05$, and we show how the properties and statistical significance of the present observational data can be used to test the theory. Moreover, we argue that two kinds of initial conditions are required to reproduce the observed properties of the late Universe: 1) the non-linear processes (ie. the simultaneous formation of angular momentum, a density gradient and a non-linear evolution of the ratio of a matter field to density field), 2) the thermal equilibrium conditions (ie. the thermal collapse of the neutral gas due to its excessive heat production), and 3) the turbulent regime. 
Although Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are typically classified by two big drawbacks in connection with these sources, they exhibit a remarkable characteristic, namely, "bounce," which happens when the brightness of the source super-sits close to the observer. This phenomenon can then become possible as an additional source which can be observable, such as a gamma-ray burst (GRB). By means of some simple tests we investigate the possibility of this phenomenon in various circumstances. If the energy levels of the bursts and the photon fraction in their kinetic energy are considered simultaneously, we find that the energy well taken together can provide a good indicator of the peak-to-burst rate ratio in the range of 200 - 10^3. If the energy and photon fraction are normalized, a robust analytic solution is given for the spectrum, based on the general relativistic and non-relativistic scenario. These results in general are compatible with the high estimate of the efficiency of electrons in prompt emission in the TeV-X-ray energy range, since the energy flux above 20 GeV is insufficient for a typical burst. 
Context: The coupling of large-scale structure with matter has a significant impact on cosmological models. Varying-G is a phenomenological extension of the gravity principle, and provides a versatile combination of solutions to large-scale structure models with negligible internal displacements, at the expense of generative background generation. Aims: We examine the signal of this signature in cosmological models with large-scale power spectrum and phase space density perturbations. Methods: The standard cosmological model with the curvature constant $k=1$, surrounded by an inflaton field with an invariant squared potential, becomes highly unstable, and our models are subject to several modifications. The propagation parameter $\k$ for the scalar field provides an easy test to quantify the correlation between the density perturbations and the curvature $\ell$. Results: In the absence of strong covariance of the scalar field, the overall signal decreases steadily with the scale factor $q$ as $z^2/2$ for power law functions $q<=2$. We find that when the curvature $\ell$ can be considered as a scale factor only, the interaction between both $k$ and $\ell$ is negligible, and this behavior is useful to constrain cosmology in different nonlinear regimes. Conclusions: We confirm the recent findings of McQuillan, Hamilton & Alfresco that the gravitational field instability does not determine the scalar tensor number $n_s$ $>0$ and that, with parameterization of the scalar field $\ell$, the presence of the scalar tensor is unlikely to influence the interpretation of large-scale structure statistics. However, it is still possible to generate large-scale structures with quadratic coefficients $\sigma=0$ at $z^2/2\leq 1$, and at $z^2/2\leq 2\leq 1$, as well as $\langle Q\sigma^{\alpha}/(\Lambda^3)/2\rangle$ at $z \gg 0$. We also discuss the feasibility of our system in the context of the prediction of the Small Magellanic Cloud mass function. 
This work deals with a minimal, yet highly tractable, renormalizable perturbation in an axion-like fluid, where the curvature perturbation is characterized by the inflaton field via the standard one-loop approximation and where the coupling constant is the Landau entropy of the fluid. One implication of this approach is that the propagation of quantum fluctuations through such a fluid is much more controlled than the usual one-loop approximation, and the resultant quantum fluctuations are no longer constant. In this limit, with a non-zero kinetic energy, the fluctuations are uniform, similar to inflation. 
We have obtained super-horizon axion-like particle (AGB) model calculations in the presence of an effective Galileon scalar coupling with the vector $a$. We find that the evolution of the dark matter density perturbations across different inflationary scale will greatly change the nature of the pair creation scenario at low mass level by tens of GeV. With the right corrections on the temperature and mixing vectors, this instability has a non-trivial evolution. The exact evolution of inflationary models can be explained only through a simple N-body theory with no backgrounds. We then show that the super-horizon axion masses are predicted by Minkowski-Cartan inflation with negligible scale-dependent corrections. Our results represent a promising approach to interpret model phenomenology, and may help in exploring the possibility of coupling $a$ to the standard model when performing modified gravity (Minkowski-Cartan) inflationary scenario. 
We present results of numerical simulations of the formation of primordial black holes that deviate from the 1-field theory that describes the dynamics of primordial black holes. Although a stable black hole mass regime develops into the 2-field regime, the black hole growth rates are not highly variable, typically significant during the initial formation epoch. The supermassive black holes they generate and the number of black holes in their cores are typically similar to black hole densities today. Our simulations suggest that primordial black holes can be self-consistently seeded if the number of isolated black holes is sufficiently large compared to the black hole mass to warrant the existence of an intrinsically infinite supermassive black hole population. We show that the non-linear numerical instability introduced by the supermassive black holes in the super-Eddington regime is able to explain the observed two-point correlation function and constrain the condensate mass function that emerges from the core collapse, on the basis of a constant mass mass function in the initial conditions of the Universe. 
We consider collisional equilibrium, particle production and the primordial Universe at the transition from a cosmological scale up to a quark-dominated density, postulating a prescription to construct supernovae and the tensor perturbations that should result from such results at the relevant scales, i.e. the intermediate regime. From the macroscopic solutions, we build analytical models to study how self-consistent supernovae and quark matter production are integrated over many small scales. Our models trace the origin of various cosmological observables, e.g. the non-Gaussianity, the Gaussian cosmological perturbation spectrum, the $\Lambda$CDM and the model of spontaneous decoupling of the primordial perturbations. We compare these models to simulations of the primordial Universe, finding agreement and consistency between models which both take into account the observed effects of small scale minima, recombination, and non-Gaussianity. A rough estimate of the amount of collisional contributions in the universe is given by assuming an initial period of ~2 Gyr, which corresponds to a temperature range of about 5x10^{20}-5x10^{21} K, as in some recent MOND experiments. Finally, we determine the observed amplitudes of cosmic rays in the Universe to have a statistical significance of ~0.1 mJy/s, a statistical significance of ~0.01 mJy/s, and high values of the reheating constant to be from about 5x10^{-17} erg/s in a new scenario. 
We present a model of cosmic history which predicts that in the early universe there would be periods when galaxies would be primordial and when no other real observable happens. The scenario relies on several assumptions in the model, among them the existence of dark matter and the existence of the massive black hole. The models also predict that in the future the late Universe can be a cosmological constant, just as today. 
Collisions are ubiquitous in black holes with a characteristic speed a few billion meters/s. Since these types of collisions are rarely seen in active galactic nuclei, it is important to take into account the formation and dynamical evolution of those particles before their collisions are supposed to dominate the overall inflow of energy. The general mechanism by which these collisions grow in the binary systems is unknown, but a simple model that describes the propagation of both particle and Eddington flow motion on multiple orbits shows how both should affect the growth of particles on such orbital timescales. 
Relativity was originally interpreted as a potential relic component in string theory. The linear evolution of such a possibility was uncovered in the years 2000 - 2005 by the gravitational wave sources LIGO 170819 - 172258, LIGO 170819 - 172322 and LIGO 170817, amongst others, and our understanding of the origin of this relic has become increasingly applicable to cosmology since the first string astronomy experiments were conceived. LIGO 170819 - 172258 and LIGO 170817 have provided observational breakthroughs in this regard, providing direct access to the black hole in the Universe and searching for relics, as demonstrated by the detection of gravitational radiation in the LIGO space telescope data. This article presents here the expected relic signal in the waveform of LIGO 170819-172258 and the enhancement in the amplitude of gravitational waves, two techniques that have been proposed as alternative to LIGO and string cosmology with relic component. 
The origin and trajectory of inspiraling neutron-star binaries (NS-NS) can be modeled in many ways. In order to study the dynamical evolution and obliquity of the inspiraling binary, we explore several aspects of the innermost stable circular orbit theory (ICTS), in which the orbits of star-forming NSs exhibit the characteristics of a tidal tails. We perform numerical simulations of NS-NS binary evolution. When the initially low-mass star's spin frequency exceeds about 3 eV, we obtain an initial eccentricity of about 11. However, when the inclination of the target increases with orbital inclination, the mass function of the matter on the primary star diverges. This leads to a conservative long-term instability of the NS surface, which can lead to binary inspiral in which the NS surface has a steeper rotation curve and develops a more complicated orbit. As a result, the low spin frequency of star-forming NSs makes them non-rotating in the presence of a tidal tail, which results in eccentricity distributions and an unstable outer stable circular orbit. 
We study the possibility of measuring Einstein's critical distance using the Jacobi equation (1D) assuming two versions of the Dirac equations. We study the geometric regime where the form of the Jacobi equation is valid and the geometry is considered. We show that the general equilibrium solution of our solution can be obtained via three-dimensional simulations. Then we compute a method which, for good computational efficiency, is feasible. 
A new solution of the Equation of State (EOS) problem in general relativity is presented. This new solution of the equations is characterized by two co-moving numerical solutions that are then formulated for the spherical, aperiodic and isotropic orbits. It is found that both solutions will produce different physical types of stable, axisymmetric equilibrium configurations in the Einstein frame of the case that we consider. We give examples of the unstable modes, and its exact solution in case of spherical and isotropic orbits. 
Recent observations suggest that nuclear gravitational perturbations induced by the Universe produce a large range of other large-scale physical quantities. These quantities can in principle be used to compute the back reaction problem for these quantities.   In this paper, we explore the response in this back reaction problem, whose appearance at large scales can be used to trace back the behaviour of the perturbations. We also analyze the origin of the back reaction problem at small scales, which turns out to have a further important role for the GUT metric. 
The timing of the first and second harmonic superconducting waves in Hawking-loop phase transitions between modes is known to be a consequence of radio-acoustic damping in a moving, weakly interacting, deflection-limited linear dipole-mode. Such a large uncertainty is in itself proof of the presence of gravitational radiation. We discuss here an important component of a measurement problem in the case of null-state signals in Hawking-loop phase transition. A simplified estimate of the time delays due to fluctuations in these modes, and a description of the acoustic stability of this signal, is provided in this contribution. 
The mixing mode propagating through the intracluster medium (ICM) in reheating phases of the universe can be completely ignored if the energy density of reheating energy is small and the energy density of the primordial fluid is small. The result is that the evolutions of the perturbation equations will not take place. Our new results, which apply to cosmological perturbation as well as to inflation, show that the quantum dynamics and the observability of $z$ of cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations are of order their radial value. This result also gives access to an even larger number of phenomenological probes than in the case of inflation. 
We investigate the problem of the missing dark matter (DM) removal at the level of a classical statistical theory. In this theory the Cosmic-length universe is simply related to an effective squared-sum-function (E-type) allowing for cosmological $w^2$ solutions to a standard LCDM. We show that the E-type gives rise to a nonlinear kinetic Dark Matter feedback in cosmological perturbations within the CDM model and show that both in the CDM and universe of today, the DM is present. We discuss why this weakly coupled field can have so far been ruled out in a model where the dark matter-dynamics interactions in the Universe are excluded. Furthermore, we show that the imprint of the observed cross section on the DM annihilation process is restored. This represents the first direct detection of the new models of DM annihilation. In this case a DM energy density scale would fit the cosmic-length universe well within a range for which the mass ratio of DM to $M_{\rm d}$ varies as a function of mass. 
The simplest Newtonian mechanism of gravity, consisting of constant and an infinitely-dimred gauge field, describes asymptotically a general, chiral spacetime to an arbitrary de Broglie-Rudwig configuration. The latter condensates all vector fields into an arbitrary single gauge field at first order and in the conformally-flat regime with its non-unique set of couplings. Such self-similar condensations can lead to energy dissipation on scales larger than $\sim$ a couple of the Ricci scalar radii. We study the perturbations in such conformal-flat and conformal-symmetric regimes by considering for example general new gauge transformations of this cosmological constant. The scalar moments ($\sigma_0$ and $\sigma_r$) are known by means of an isotropic formulation of the gauge field theory of inflation. We find a novel result and derive cosmological cosmological parameters both with and without scalar momentum violation. We discuss the violation of general relativity via phantom models and demonstrate how the crucial role of gravitation in perturbations is different from that in general relativity. We find in particular, for a set of scalar charges with zero a priori an energy loss due to Ricci scalar field, and therefore within a set of bound theories, we can obtain energy spectra of gauge field that do not obey the conformal symmetry, namely, tensor quartic modes of freedom. The corresponding energy spectra depend on the scalar gravity equation of state $\sigma_0$ and depend on the gauge field theory also. Using this discussion we can more easily apply cosmological bounds to gauge transformations in order to measure the mass-redshift distribution of the universe. 
It is shown that in a gravitational thermodynamic theory, baryonic mass, electron density, and rotation speed of a binary system undergo a modification in their form. The long term structure of a binary system is used to predict the results of a numerical relativity simulation. 
New gravitational wave detectors, such as LSST or Advanced LIGO and Virgo, which can detect diffuse gravitational waves, will potentially detect large fluctuations in the microwave background (DM) anisotropies of a large gravitational wave background (GWB). We perform an observational study of the effect of these fluctuations on the light curves of upcoming detectors. Specifically, we use a novel one-dimensional correlation function to estimate the coupling constants for 10 GWB measurements. We demonstrate that these constraints are consistent with those obtained with the ADB experiment of the Advanced LIGO team and that both experiments are in strong disagreement over their own GWB GWB sensitivity limits. If those constraints, or if future GW detectors are also in weak agreement, then the amplification of the photons emitted by the proposed DM experiment by the GWB event will dominate at high energies. The anticipated value of the lensing correction required for future GW detectors is less than 1% for GWB 170817 and 20% for GWB 180717. Future searches will require more direct estimates of these uncertainties than those at present. The prospects for detection of gravitational waves by such a GWB GWB event will be discussed and discussed. 
We point out in response to the proposal of Kim and Kim (1998) that a number of quasi-local pulsation modes, related to the t--wave (vertical perturbation), could be identified with the ``tunneling'' of the Universe due to tides. This solution, found by Kim and Kim, is successful only on an ``siren'' scale. It can, however, fail for systems larger than the current limit where asymptotically significant perturbations can be directly present. 
The general formulas for the radial, rotational and orbital velocities of cosmic strings are derived analytically. We consider in detail the implications for the parameters of cosmological strings, the simple parameterization of Lorentz factors, and their stable form. All these equations are found to converge to a general solution in pure gravitational theory and their exact solutions follow fairly well the Einstein-Boltzmann solutions.
